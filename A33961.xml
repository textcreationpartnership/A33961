            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is my <hi>Experience</hi> (after more than thirty years ſervice of God in the work of the Miniſtry) that hath brought forth theſe meditations to thy view, in which time, I have been ſent for to, and converſed with many, who have laboured under the <hi>three firſt</hi> of theſe <hi>horrid temptations,</hi> as to which this Diſcourſe offers ſomething of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction</hi> and <hi>Counſel,</hi> upon ſome of which they have had as ſad iſſues as can well be imaginable; and to all (the firſt of them at leaſt) hath been the moſt intollerable <hi>bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> and <hi>affliction,</hi> that a reaſonable Soul is capable of bearing. This hath put me upon frequent ſtudies, what to ſay or do for their relief. Who would not do his utmoſt, to lend an helping hand to a ſoul, crying out, <hi>That it feeleth an Hell upon Earth!</hi> to help a poor creature, <hi>whoſe ſleep departeth from him in the night,</hi> and in the day time he can find no place to reſt, but is uneaſie in his or her greateſt circumſtances of eaſe; whom he ſeeth <hi>trembling,</hi> that he is not able to ſpeak and continue a ſentence to him to its period. This
<pb facs="tcp:62919:3"/> I have ſeen, and mine Ears have heard. I have known ſome lying under one or other of theſe Temptations, <hi>months</hi> and <hi>years,</hi> and for a great part of the time under ſuch a burthen, that they have paſſionately ſaid, <hi>They would heartily forgive any that would take away their lives,</hi> and (which is moſt tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous) for want of ſuch an executioner, I have known ſome do it with their own hands. Under the greateſt <hi>circumſtance:</hi> for <hi>content</hi> imaginably, bleſſed with a <hi>competent eſtate,</hi> acceptable relations, and wanting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a <hi>quiet mind.</hi> O that it might be a warning to the <hi>Athieſts</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemers</hi> of this Generation. They know not how ſoon thoſe <hi>Atheiſtical and Blaſphemous Thoughts and Expreſſions,</hi> with which their hearts are filled, and which they make now the <hi>Ornaments of their Speech,</hi> may reflect to this degree upon them. I have obſerved in theſe diſtreſſes, perſons nearly concerned in ſuch as have been thus afflicted, at loſs for ſome Diſcourſe, purpoſely wrote upon theſe Arguments, which if they could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade their friends <hi>in theſe paroxiſmes</hi> to read, yet they might read to them, or at leaſt from which they might be furniſhed with matter of proper diſcourſe or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to them. This hath made me ſpend ſome few hours upon this Argument, which tho
<pb facs="tcp:62919:3"/> it be not the general concern of Chriſtians (they being through the Goodneſs of God, but few of many, that are incumbred with the three firſt of the Temptations here ſpoken to) yet in another ſenſe are the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>concern of all;</hi> none of us knowing which of us may not fall into theſe Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations common to men: nor what friend or neighbour of ours may next ſtand in need of our help; and the moſt being at too great a loſs, how properly to apply themſelves to Chriſtians under theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. Indeed the laſt Temptation is of more <hi>general concern;</hi> we are all apt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to receive temptations to <hi>Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Theſe conſiderations, together with my <hi>obſervation,</hi> that in theſe late years in which <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> have been ſo <hi>rampant,</hi> and profanely triumphing almoſt at the end of every looſe and ungoverned Tongue; theſe Temptations have alſo been more frequent, hath made me willing to let theſe <hi>Meditations</hi> paſs into a publick view, that they may be of more than a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate uſe. I ſhall think my ſelf abundantly rewarded for my pains, if but one Soul may be <hi>fore-warned</hi> or <hi>relieved</hi> by them, or any thing be ſaid in theſe ſheets, which any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Chriſtians may make uſe of for a <hi>word in ſeaſon,</hi> to any one Soul thus <hi>wearied.</hi> I
<pb facs="tcp:62919:4"/> weigh not the ſcoffs of thoſe who mock at theſe things; experience lets all that mind Religion know theſe Temptations are no <hi>Chimaera's,</hi> and thoſe who judge them meer <hi>Melancholick Delirations</hi> and the <hi>Effects</hi> of them, know not what they ſay, but muſt ſay ſomething, tho it be to diſcover their ignorance of the ways of <hi>Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> and no acquaintance with the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Sathan.</hi> Such as theſe <hi>Meditations</hi> are, they are not intended for ſuch as are <hi>ſcoffers</hi> at <hi>wounded</hi> and <hi>troubled ſpirits;</hi> but for a relief for thoſe who feel ſuch wounds, and in whoſe hearts the infernal <hi>Plow-man</hi> hath made ſuch <hi>deep furrows:</hi> and for thoſe who know no Temptation of this nature hath befallen others, but ſuch as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to men, and wherewith they alſo may be Tempted.

               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Laſtly, I <hi>ſhall offer my beſt advice</hi> both for <hi>Souls not as yet under theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,</hi> for the Prevention of them; and for <hi>Souls</hi> under this <hi>great preſſure,</hi> for the Arming and Supporting of them againſt and under them, and procuring them Liberty from them.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:62919:11"/>
               <p>1. Qu. <hi>What are thoſe thoughts that deſerve the name of Atheiſtical</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemous?</hi> The term <hi>Atheiſme</hi> is taken ſometimes more <hi>ſtrictly</hi> for a <hi>denyal of God:</hi> ſometimes more <hi>largely</hi> for a denyal of any of the <hi>Perfections of God.</hi> In the firſt Senſe, for a man to think, <hi>That there is no God,</hi> or <hi>that the Father,</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> or the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> is not God, is <hi>Atheiſme;</hi> when it is onely a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial in the <hi>Heart,</hi> it is an <hi>Atheiſtical Thought,</hi> when we deny it with our <hi>Lipps</hi> they are <hi>Atheſtical words:</hi> more <hi>largely</hi> for a man to deny Gods <hi>Wiſdom, Power, Knowledg, Mercy,</hi> or any other of his Perfections, is <hi>Atheiſm. Blaſphemy</hi> is committed three ways. 1. By denial of the <hi>Perfections that are in God.</hi> If any ſhall deny God to be one in <hi>Eſſence,</hi> or the three <hi>Perſons in the God-head,</hi> or that God is a <hi>Spirit Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, Omniſufficient,</hi> &amp;c. is <hi>Blaſphemy:</hi> It is an evil and injurious ſpeaking of God. 2. <hi>When the Divine Perfections are attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Creature,</hi> ſuch I mean as belong to God onely, as to think any Creature <hi>Infinite, Omnipotent, Eternal, Omniſufficient,</hi> &amp;c. 3. <hi>When the Imporfections of Creatures are aſcribed to God;</hi> as if any <hi>thinketh in his heart,</hi> That <hi>God is mortal,</hi> that he is the <hi>Author</hi> or Countenancer of <hi>Sin,</hi> or any thing of like nature which agrees to the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62919:11"/> Creature, onely in regard of the imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. Thus you ſee there may be a <hi>great variety</hi> of <hi>Atheiſtical</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemous Thoughts,</hi> according to the variety of the <hi>Object,</hi> which may be the <hi>Being of God,</hi> or the <hi>Perfections of God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Again, Such kind of Thoughts when they are <hi>fixed</hi> and <hi>permanent,</hi> are either <hi>ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died up by us, bugg'd,</hi> and <hi>imbraced,</hi> and inlarged upon, ſo as the Soul ſtudies to feed them and maintain them; which are hardly found in any but <hi>Atheiſtical Souls,</hi> that find it their intereſt to ſecure their luſts, by ſuch <hi>principles:</hi> Or elſe they are the <hi>Souls trouble</hi> and <hi>burthen,</hi> and great <hi>Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> like a Viper ſticking to their hands, and there 'twill ſtick. They cry out and roar, and endeavour to ſhake theſe thoughts off, but they recurr, and are like an ill ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing noiſe in their ears, and inconceivably af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict them: They ſay, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan,</hi> but he will not be gone. They cry to God, but he is pleaſed not to take the thorn out of their ſouls. Theſe are <hi>Temptations,</hi> and they are <hi>Atheiſtical</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemous Thoughts,</hi> thus circumſtanced, that I now deſign to ſpeak ſomething to: So that I exclude out of my Diſcourſe,</p>

                  <hi>EVery Man when he is tempted is drawn away by his own Luſt and enticed,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>James (1 Jam.)</hi> He is <hi>enticed</hi>

                     </gap>ſſions</hi> of this nature, that he can hope ſhould prevail with it to receive any ſuch
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62919:15"/> impreſſions: For the Soul of Man being a <hi>rational being,</hi> is not like, without ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> or a <hi>ſhew of it,</hi> to be brought over to agree to any ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What if we ſhould ſay that poſſibly the <hi>Tempter promiſeth himſelf no ſuch ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,</hi> what if his deſign be not to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyte a Religious Soul to the Propoſition which is contrived in his Suggeſtion, but meerly to weary the Chriſtian out of his life by the conſtant trouble of his impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity; and indeed I believe that <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> ſo it is, and that theſe are but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative Temptations to <hi>Self-murther</hi> and Deſpair, if he cannot by theſe Suggeſtions perſwade the Soul to <hi>blaſpheme God,</hi> or to deny Gods Infinite Beng and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; yet if he can but ſtir up in the Soul ſuch a degree of <hi>Impatience,</hi> under this ſore affliction, as will put the man upon determining his own life deliberately, he hath done his work. Hence it is that in all the Courſe of my Miniſtry I never obſerved Man or Woman long under theſe Temptations, but they fell into Temptations of the later Nature; which I the rather hint to you, that you may watch upon, and pray for perſons, who are brought under theſe moſt ſad and diſmal
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62919:16"/> circumſtances. They are ordinary <hi>Praelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diums</hi> and <hi>Prologues</hi> to ſuch <hi>Tragedies,</hi> and in this caſe he is not much concerned to bring Arguments before the Soul, it is to be deſtroyed another way.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But indeed as to other Souls, to whom theſe <hi>Temptations</hi> are not <hi>Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> but meer Diverſions and <hi>Recreations,</hi> he muſt uſe <hi>Arguments,</hi> and he may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them even to Pious and <hi>Religious Souls,</hi> how little ſoever they avail. The Arguments cannot be many which can be brought in ſuch a Cauſe. They are uſually brought from one of theſe three Heads:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>From the want of the Evidence of Senſe to prove a Divine Being.</hi> Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Beings are in this diſtinguiſhed from thoſe that are bodily, that having no <hi>Accidents,</hi> no Qualities, ſuch as Colour, or the like; they are not evident to our <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Senſes.</hi> God is called the <hi>Inviſible</hi> and who (ſaith the Holy Ghoſt) <hi>hath ſeen God at any time?</hi> Indeed no Spiritual be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can be ſeen, who ever ſaw the <hi>Soul</hi> of a Man, or an <hi>Angel</hi> (unleſs in an aſſumed Shape) and I look upon the queſtioning of any ſuch beings, as <hi>Spirits,</hi> in our age, a fair Argument of the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſme that is in thoſe <hi>Philoſophers</hi> Hearts.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62919:16"/> Yet are we Creatures ſo much made up of <hi>Fleſh and Blood,</hi> that we are hard to believe any thing but what we ſee; that is indeed to believe any thing at all: for ſeeing and believing are two things very diverſe one from another. <hi>Who ever ſaw God</hi> (faith the Devil) or who at any time hath heard his Voice, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> But this is an Argument fit only for Senſual Brutes, and not for any deliberate Soul to be catched by.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He will, therefore (Secondly) argue from <hi>Reaſon,</hi> which is not able by <hi>ſearching to find out God unto perfection.</hi> It is uſually ſaid, <hi>Animal nihil plus Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mali ſapit. That a living creature knows nothing beyond a living creature of its own ſize and perfection.</hi> Upon this account it is reaſonably ſaid, That if a <hi>brute Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> could deſcribe a Man, it would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe him as a <hi>Brute,</hi> not being able to conceive of a Creature beyond its degree of Perfection. It is eaſie for a man, if he will but make uſe of his own reaſon, to conclude that there muſt be a <hi>God,</hi> a Firſt Being, and a Firſt Cauſe; for that nothing can give a being to, or be the firſt cauſe of it ſelf, is a principle ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural unto us, as we cannot out-face it, nor by our higheſt debauchery is extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht; but however the <hi>Firſt Being</hi> ſhould
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62919:17"/> give a being to it ſelf, or the <hi>Firſt Cauſe</hi> be its <hi>own cauſe,</hi> this is very hard to conceive, until the Soul be aſſiſted by a Divine Light. And the <hi>Divine Being</hi> being ſo far tranſcendent in its <hi>perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> to all the <hi>perfections</hi> that are found in the greateſt and wiſeſt of the Sons of Men, it is yet harder to conceive of it aright and not to <hi>blaſpheme</hi> it in our thoughts: We are Creatures that are <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by Time, Circumſcribed by Air</hi> and <hi>Certain Meaſures,</hi> and it is very hard to us to conceive that there ſhould be a Being without theſe boundaries, The <hi>Immenſity, Omnipotence, Omniſcience, Infiniteneſs</hi> of any Being, are things tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending the reach of our Conceptions, and tho we can by Reaſon argue our ſelves ſometimes into an appearing neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of theſe Aſſertions, yet we can hardly give credit to the Eyes of our Minds, they are perfections beyond our graſp. Hence the Great Wits of the World are generally Atheiſtical, and it ſeems al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt neceſſary that men ſhould be <hi>fools, that they might be wiſe:</hi> Hence is the <hi>Socinians</hi> denial of the Trinity, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers denial of Gods <hi>Omniſcience,</hi> &amp;c. This gives the Devil a great advantage, putting the Soul upon reflections, <hi>How</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:62919:17"/> 
                  <hi>can theſe things be?</hi> Luther ſaith <hi>Non amo hos Curiſtas &amp; Quaeriſtas</hi> (he might have ſaid <hi>Quomodiſtas</hi> too) <hi>Audi Verbum Dei &amp; tace.</hi> I do not love theſe Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in Divine things. <hi>Why ſo,</hi> or <hi>Wherefore,</hi> or <hi>How are thoſe things? Hear the Word of God, and hold thy peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. A Third <hi>Argument</hi> that Satan or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily uſeth in theſe <hi>Temptations, is from the ſeeming diſorders</hi> and <hi>confuſions which the Wiſdom of Divine Providence permits in the World.</hi> Were there a God (ſaith the <hi>Devil)</hi> and were he <hi>ſuch a God</hi> as thou fancieſt, would he ſuffer his Enemies ſo to proſper, and his Servants to be ſo trampled upon? This is an Argument which our own feeble Reaſon, in compliance with our Luſts, doth often trouble us with; even <hi>David, Jeremy,</hi> and <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> were moleſted with it. As we are naturally prone to meaſure the <hi>Almighty's Power</hi> by the ſtrength of our created <hi>Arms,</hi> and his <hi>Omniſcience</hi> by the Fathom of our <hi>pitiful Comprehenſions,</hi> and his <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> by the Span of our own <hi>Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> ſo we are as prone to determine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> by our <hi>Policies.</hi> We cannot ſee to the bottom of his depths, nor look up to the top of his heights,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62919:18"/> but judge of the <hi>Infinite Wiſe God,</hi> as if we were to determine concerning a ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Politician amongſt men; ſo that whether the Argument be concluſive or no (which doubtleſs it is not) yet it is good enough for the Devil to trouble us with, to tell us, That if indeed there were a God, and ſuch a God as we have heard of, <hi>Abel</hi> ſhould not have periſhed by the hands of a bloody <hi>Cain,</hi> nor the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> been oppreſſed by ſuch a one as <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> nor <hi>Job</hi> put to ſcrape him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a pot-ſheard. The wicked ſhould not walk on every ſide, nor the vileſt men be exalted. It ſhould not happen to the righteous after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the wicked, nor yet to the wicked according to the deſert of the righteous; nothing but <hi>blind Fortune</hi> could ſhut its Eyes and wink at ſuch diſorders. Theſe now are the greateſt advantages which I can fancy the Devil to have upon any Soul, to induce it to think there is no God, or at leaſt no ſuch God as the Scripture ſpeaks of, and we ordinarily preach to you; and perſons ſolicited to ſuch a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, will find ſome ſuch thoughts as theſe ordinarily either praevious to or concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant with the other. But as I ſaid before, in ſuch caſes as I am ſpeaking to, he
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62919:18"/> ſeldom uſeth much argument, little hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to work over the Soul into ſuch a belief, onely deſigning to give it trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in order to a further end: And this is enough to have ſpoken to this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, both concerning the want of a bait that ſhould intice the Soul into this Net, and the <hi>Arguments</hi> which the <hi>Tempter</hi> ordinarily uſeth with Such Souls.</p>

Had not the Serpent firſt <hi>beguiled Eve</hi> in the State of <hi>Innocence,</hi> we had not poſſibly been expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſuch <hi>Suggeſtions,</hi> or at leaſt not to ſuch <hi>Impreſſions</hi> from them; we might have had them, but they had not bin ſo wounding to us: The Infernal Plow-man might have plowed, but he had not made ſuch long Furrows: by theſe <hi>Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions</hi> in our Souls he had but led this Plough upon a Rock, and attempted us with them as vainly as he did our Saviour. While our firſt <hi>Parents</hi> were in their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of <hi>Innocency,</hi> the Devil aſſaulted them with a <hi>Temptation</hi> of this <hi>Nature;</hi> Gen. 3. 1, 2, 3. He did not attempt to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the Woman, <hi>That there was no God,</hi> (Our firſt <hi>Parents</hi> were too lately come out of their Creators hands, to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62919:19"/> That there was no Supreme Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing precedent to them) but he deſigned to beget in them blaſphemous and moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy thoughts of God. That he had deceived them, and not told them the Truth, when he ſaid to them, <hi>That in the day they did eat of the fruit of the Tree of Good and Evil, they ſhould die;</hi> and that by it he deſigned to deprive them of a very great part of their happineſs: which makes it evident that Man even in his moſt perfect State, was capable of ſuch Suggeſtions. How far the poſterity of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> ſhould have been troubled with this gueſt, had <hi>Eve</hi> at firſt ſhut him out of doors; we cannot tell. Chriſt himſelf heard ſomething of this Noiſe in the Wilderneſs, <hi>Matth</hi> 4. But with this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, 1. <hi>That he had not a Power to embrace ſuch Motions,</hi> they could not be impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive upon him, who was the <hi>Expreſs I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of his Fathers Perſon,</hi> and God <hi>Equal with his Father over all, bleſſed for Ever;</hi> nor could they any way torment him, or be afflictive to him. He had a perfect power to repel them, without the leaſt <hi>Affliction</hi> or Diſturbance unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <hi>Adam</hi> had a Paſſive Capacity to receive theſe <hi>Fiery Darts,</hi> to give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to theſe <hi>Vile Suggeſtions,</hi> and to ſin
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62919:20"/> by occaſion of them; and the Children of <hi>Adam</hi> have not onely a <hi>Paſſive Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city</hi> to receive ſuch <hi>Impreſſions,</hi> but an <hi>Active Power</hi> and <hi>Capacity;</hi> yea, poſſibly more than ſo, an <hi>Inclination</hi> and <hi>Propenſion</hi> to feed upon them, to their defilement: and poſſibly there are ſcare any Souls in the World, which at one time or other have not been defiled with them, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before or after <hi>Converſion,</hi> though in very <hi>different degrees.</hi> In ſome they have been more <hi>tranſient</hi> and <hi>volatile,</hi> in others more <hi>fixed</hi> and <hi>permanent.</hi> In ſome Souls they been entertained as <hi>Gueſts,</hi> and as it were <hi>adopted</hi> into their Family, to others they have been but as <hi>violent knockings and rappings at the doors,</hi> or like the throwing in of Stones at the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, which the Maſter of the Houſe could not help. Further yet, as to <hi>particular Souls</hi> troubled with them, they may for ought I know have bin <hi>occaſioned</hi> by, or <hi>advantaged from,</hi> thoſe Souls former guilt.</p>
               <p>I ſay <hi>occaſioned</hi> from it. God by his Righteous Judgment ſuffering the <hi>Devil to ſtand at Peoples Right-hand in a juſt Puniſhment of them,</hi> for their not ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be <hi>Rooted,</hi> and <hi>Grounded in the Faith,</hi> for their <hi>Deſultory Levity,</hi> and <hi>Incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> in the things of God; or ſome other
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62919:20"/> Sins. They may be <hi>Advantaged from ſome former Guilt,</hi> when Perſons have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allowed themſelves to <hi>read</hi> Prophane and Atheiſtical Books, to liſten unto, and hear profane and <hi>Atheiſtical Diſcourſes,</hi> to Feed upon <hi>Atheiſtical Arguments, &amp;c.</hi> But this is not the Queſtion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly</hi> therefore, I conclude: That ſuch <hi>Motions</hi> and <hi>Impreſſions</hi> (or if you will ſo call them) Thoughts, as are received with Horrour and Trouble, and Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and are not delighted in, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by the Soul, I ſay, <hi>Thoughts thus cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtanced, let them have never ſo much Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> in <hi>them, are not the Guilt of that Soul that feeleth the Load and Burthen of them.</hi> Now this being ſo great, if not the onely thing, that can ſucceſsfully be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the <hi>Relief of Souls</hi> under them; I ſhall endeavour to juſtify this <hi>Concluſion</hi> by ſome following Arguments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. My firſt ſhall be <hi>from the Received O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of Divines: That the very firſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Sins are not Sins.</hi> Every man may obſerve in his Soul a threefold <hi>Motion</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a ſinful Act: 1. There is a Motion which is called <hi>Primo Primus,</hi> the very firſt; and indeed is not the <hi>Motion of the Soul,</hi> but a Motion to the Soul, a <hi>Forreign</hi> not a <hi>Domeſtick intrinſick</hi> Motion, but
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62919:21"/> from the <hi>Devil</hi> or the Men of the World. The Second is attended with ſome inward <hi>Delight</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure.</hi> When there is not only a <hi>Motion</hi> made to the Soul to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is Evil, but it cauſeth ſome <hi>Ticklings</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure</hi> in the Soul. Tho poſſibly the Soul as yet reſolves not on it, nor deſireth the producing of it into Act, yet it is pleaſed with it, and the Motion is ſweet to its Taſte. This is what <hi>Divines</hi> call <hi>Concupiſcence,</hi> what the Scripture calleth <hi>Luſt,</hi> and is doubtleſs <hi>Sinful,</hi> and forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in the <hi>Tenth Commandement;</hi> without which the Apoſtle ſaith he had not known it to be Sin: <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 7. The Third is, That <hi>Motion</hi> by which the Soul moveth towards the <hi>Actual Commiſſion of it,</hi> reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving upon it, contriving how to bring it about; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is forbidden in every Commandement, which according to our Saviours Interpretation of the <hi>Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,</hi> doth not only reſtrain and prohibit the overt Act, but all the inward Motions of the Heart, tendent and leading to ſuch Act: but the firſt is prohibited in no Command.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor indeed is it reaſonable for any to fancy that it ſhould; <hi>for it is not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to imagine that God ſhould forbid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s Acts that are not our Acts.</hi> Motions of this
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62919:21"/> Nature are not our Actions, we are only the <hi>Objects of them,</hi> not the <hi>Agents</hi> in them. When God forbiddeth us Sin, he forbiddeth us not to <hi>omit</hi> ſomething which he hath Commanded us to do, or to forbear ſomething which he requireth us not to avoid. He doth not forbid us the <hi>Actions of others, which we cannot prevent.</hi> Suggeſtions and Impreſſions of this Nature are the meer Actions of others, to which we no way concurr. What are not our Acts cannot be our Sins.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, I argue from the Words of our Saviour, <hi>Matth. 15. 11. Not that which goeth into a Man d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>liſhneſs; all theſe Evil things come from within, and defile the Man.</hi> I know
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62919:22"/> our Saviour is there diſcourſing, relating to the Phariſaical Superſticious Conceit of Mens being Defiled by <hi>Eating with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waſhen hands.</hi> But this Diſcourſe led him to lay down ſome General Maxims of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Truth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That</hi> that <hi>which meerly entreth into a Man</hi> from <hi>without, cannot defile him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That what defileth a Man, muſt be ſomething of his own, ſomething which cometh out of himſelf.</hi> His Deſtruction muſt be from himſelf.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That amongſt theſe things may be Evil Thoughts, for they proceed from the Heart;</hi> v. 21.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>That what proceedeth not from the Heart, cannot Defile.</hi> Let me now a little Apply this to the preſent purpoſe: <hi>Atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> and Blaſphemous Thoughts thus Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtanced, do <hi>meerly Enter into us from without;</hi> we ſuppoſe the Soul not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive and breed them, not to ſtudy and delight in them: They are in a Senſe <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Man,</hi> the Soul hears the Noiſe, feels the Impreſſion of them, but they Enter <hi>from without,</hi> from an <hi>Agent</hi> that is without the Man. Secondly, They are not a <hi>Mans own,</hi> he doth not Hugg or Imbrace them, or Feed upon them; they are but as Baſtards laid at his Door, not born in his Houſe,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62919:22"/> not bred of his own Soul. Thirdly, Though they be <hi>Evil Thoughts,</hi> yet they proceed <hi>not from the Heart.</hi> A Mans <hi>Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power</hi> relates to his <hi>Senſitive Part,</hi> his <hi>Underſtanding</hi> is but the <hi>Out-room</hi> of his Soul: Thus far indeed theſe <hi>Evil Thoughts</hi> enter into a Man, they make ſome Impreſſions upon his <hi>Power of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination;</hi> that is an <hi>Open Faculty,</hi> to which a Man hath no Lock or Barr, ſo long as there are Senſible Objects, or Sinful A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents in the World, they will have ſome Paſſage into this Entry of the Soul of Man. The <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> which is the <hi>Porter to</hi> the <hi>Heart,</hi> takes ſome Cognizance of all Paſſengers into it, ſo as a Man may have ſome <hi>Notions</hi> and take ſome <hi>Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance,</hi> and make ſome <hi>Judgment</hi> of theſe <hi>Evil Thoughts;</hi> but yet they are not come into the <hi>Heart,</hi> which is the <hi>Will of Man:</hi> here they come not, out of this they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed not, they are not <hi>willed,</hi> nor <hi>choſen,</hi> they are not loved nor delighted in, the Soul melts not in any imbraces of them, but is ſcared at the ſight of them; abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minateth, rejecteth and abhorreth them. So as theſe things <hi>proceed not out of the Heart</hi> nor indeed were ever admitted into the Heart.</p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:62919:23"/>
               <p>4. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If theſe were the Souls Guilt, how ſhall we excuſe our Saviour from <hi>Guilt,</hi> or <hi>Eve</hi> before ſhe yielded to the <hi>Tempter,</hi> or <hi>Joſeph,</hi> though he reſiſted the Motion of his Miſtriſs. Our Saviour was made like unto us in all things <hi>(Sin only excepted)</hi> but how ſhall he be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from Guilt, if <hi>Satans</hi> troubleſome Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to him were a Guilt? The Devil tempted him, though not to things of this Nature, yet to ſinful Acts, to <hi>diſtruſt</hi> the <hi>Providence of God,</hi> to <hi>deſtroy himſelf, &amp;c.</hi> He received his Suggeſtions with deteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and abhorrence, he ſaid to him, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan.</hi> The Devil was Guilty by his Motions, but no Guilt clave to our Saviour, rejecting and abominat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Motions. It is true, he did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them with that Paſſion, that <hi>Horrour</hi> and <hi>Trembling</hi> which Pious Men oft do, but that only ſpeaks him freed from that <hi>Paſſion</hi> and <hi>Weakneſs</hi> under which we labour. Again, Who will ſay that <hi>Eve,</hi> our Firſt Parent, ſinned, by hearing the <hi>Serpent</hi> ſpeak to her, before <hi>ſhe ſaw the Tree was Good for Food, and that it was Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to the Eyes, and a Tree to be deſired to make one Wiſe: And took of the Fruit thereof, and did Eat?</hi> Who will ſay, That <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Miſtriſs, ſoliciting him to lie with
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62919:23"/> her, was his Guilt? <hi>She caſt her Eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, ſhe ſaid, Lie with me.</hi> But he refuſed, as you read; he ſaid, <hi>How ſhall I do this great wickedneſs, and ſin againſt God?</hi> Neither was this a ſingle but repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Motion: She was Importunate with him. The Text ſaith, <hi>Gen. 39. 10. That ſhe ſpake to him day by day,</hi> but the Text alſo ſaith, <hi>That he hearkned not unto her to lie by her, or to be with her;</hi> and not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, <hi>Joſeph</hi> doubtleſs was not <hi>Guilty.</hi> The caſe is much the ſame with thee, the Tempter hath ſaid unto thee, <hi>Do not believe there is a God,</hi> or a <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or that he <hi>ever was made Man,</hi> or <hi>died for the ſins of man;</hi> or that God is ſuch a one, ſo <hi>Juſt,</hi> ſo <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcient, &amp;c.</hi> And thus he talks to thee <hi>day by day,</hi> but thou hearkeneſt not to the Tempter, thou wilt not ſo much as <hi>parly</hi> with, or <hi>deliberate</hi> upon them, much leſs give credit unto them; how art thou in this more Guilty than <hi>Joſeph?</hi> Tho thy Tempter dealeth with thee more ſecretly by Impreſſions on thy Spirit, his, more <hi>externally</hi> by <hi>Audible Words;</hi> and thy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation be to a more <hi>Spiritual,</hi> his to a more <hi>Fleſhly</hi> Wickedneſs, yet this <hi>Act</hi> is not more, if ſo much as his.</p>
               <p>5. Laſty, I argue from that known Maxime in Divinity, <hi>Omne peccatum eſt</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:62919:24"/> 
                  <hi>voluntarium.</hi> All ſin muſt be voluntary: It is moſt certainly true of <hi>Actual Sin:</hi> It is alſo true of <hi>Original Sin.</hi> The Sin of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> which was <hi>Peccatum Originans,</hi> was voluntary, and we all in him voluntarily hearkened to the <hi>Serpent,</hi> and had our Hands, all our Hands in <hi>Eves</hi> Hand, which ſhe reached up to pluck of the Fruit of that Tree. And for the <hi>Original</hi> Corruption and depravation of our Natures, it was but conſequent to that, and ſo contracted voluntarily. But Actual Sin muſt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently be voluntary, for an <hi>involuntary Action</hi> is no <hi>humane Action.</hi> Now in this caſe here is nothing of the Will, the poor Creature cries, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan:</hi> It would not hear ſuch a Noiſe, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain ſuch a Thought, it trembleth at the fears of the returns of them. I have ſeen one my ſelf in ſuch an Agony at but the fears of the return of them, that I have thought every Limb of him ſhaked, and trembled: I have heard another, that had recovered once from theſe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences, hearing me Diſcourſe of them, ſay, <hi>O Sir it is an Hell upon the Earth.</hi> (And theſe are but two Inſtances of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe I could name) ſo that apparently here is nothing of the Will imbracing and chuſing theſe things, nothing of the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62919:24"/> 
                  <hi>Affections, deſiring, loving, delighting</hi> in ſuch Thoughts: ſo as they cannot be the Souls defilement and guilt, tho they indeed be its moſt inſupportable Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and Affliction. This is to me ſo plain, that I can hardly conceive upon what miſtake a Soul under this intollerable Burden, ſhould charge it ſelf with Guilt, with reference to theſe Thoughts: Yet two things it may poſſibly ſay,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That it is hard to conceive that the Tempter, following this poor Soul from day to day, but that it ſhould have ſo far deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated upon, or conſented unto ſuch Thoughts, as to be rendred Guilty before God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That by giving Ear to ſome Atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Diſcourſes, or by Reading ſome Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and Atheiſtical Books, or it may be, Entertaining ſome ſuch Atheiſtical Thoughts formerly, and Arguing within it ſelf for them, it is become Guilty; and now God doth but Righteouſly puniſh it with them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To both which I ſhall oppoſe but two things,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That as to the firſt it muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the Soul, that is under theſe Impreſſions, they troubling it from day to day, month to month, and it may be year to year; whether it hath not at
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62919:25"/> all, in any degree, deliberated upon them, conſented and agreed ſo far to them, as to make it Guilty in ſome degree; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is hard to conceive, that in this thing the Soul ſhould be wholly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely Innocent: but admit it be not, yet ſurely theſe are no other <hi>Spots then what may be found in the Faces of Gods deareſt Children,</hi> no other then <hi>Sins of Infirmity,</hi> and <hi>Humane Frailty;</hi> and ſuch as in other caſes, the beſt of Men and Women daily incurr the Guilt of: which upon our daily <hi>Confeſſion and Repentance of,</hi> a Soul may warrantably expect Gods Pardon for, through the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo ought not to ly ſo heavy upon the Soul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, Admit that the Soul, before its turning unto God, may have given too much occaſion and advantage to the Tempter to offer thoſe Impreſſions; and that theſe are but <hi>youthful vanities</hi> repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us by the <hi>Tempter:</hi> yet certainly the Souls preſent <hi>abhorrence</hi> and <hi>deteſtation</hi> of them, its preſent <hi>trembling,</hi> and <hi>trouble,</hi> at the <hi>repetition</hi> of them, <hi>ought to be a far greater comfort and relief to the Soul, than the repetition of them ought to be trouble,</hi> or <hi>diſturbance.</hi> Thou heretofore had'ſt ſuch Thoughts, but then they did not trouble thee, thou didſt entertain and cheriſh
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62919:25"/> them: now the repetition of them makes thee weary of thy Life, are the greateſt burden that thou didd'ſt ever feel: What is here to diſturb thee? If thou indeed didd'ſt delight to roll over thoſe Follies, former Follies in thy Thoughts, if thy Soul al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them its cloſe embraces and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, this were ſomething formidable; but while thy Soul abhorreth, deteſteth them, while with all thy might, thou repelleſt them; it is a ſign God hath both pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thy former Guilt, as to them, and alſo renewed and changed thy Heart; then which nothing can ſpeak better for thee.</p>
               <p>So that if we wiſtly conſider it, we ſhall find, That admit a Chriſtian under theſe diſturbances, can juſtly check him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for too free an Admiſſion of ſuch Thoughts formerly, yet his preſent Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for them, abhorrence, and deteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, ſpeaks comfort, not trouble to him; and from this Diſcourſe it may eaſily be concluded, <hi>That the great Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Diſturbances of Souls upon this account, are generally groundleſs.</hi> The Souls which ſhall Account unto God another day for <hi>Atheiſtical and Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous Thoughts,</hi> are generally ſuch as <hi>never made any complaint of them.</hi> A Man never feels the Eternal Wrath of God
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62919:26"/> in another Life, for thoſe ſins, the burden of which he hath felt in this Life, and the Guilt of which he hath been truly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of, and trembled at and ſtudied to avoid: Much leſs for <hi>the ſinful acts of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, to which he hath not conſented.</hi> This is a thing ſo obvious, that one would wonder that any thing of this nature ſhould ſtick with an Intelligent Chriſtian, or with any Soul that is but indifferently acquainted with the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> and the Promiſes of the Goſpel. <hi>Haſt thou formerly been Guilty of ſome Atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Blaſphemous Thoughts, which for a time thou entertainedſt without any juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret?</hi> Or haſt thou not made ſo quick and ready an Oppoſition to them as thou oughteſt, yet thou haſt a Promiſe, <hi>Matth. 12. 31. All Sin and Blaſphemy where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with a man ſhall blaſpheme, ſhall be forgiven unto Men.</hi> To what men thinkeſt thou? What to them that perſiſt in them, and ſtudy to maintain them, or to thoſe that <hi>repent of them?</hi> Thou wilt certainly ſay to the later, not to the former. Why are thou then thus unreaſonably diſturbed? Thou heareſt that even for this Guilt, there is <hi>a Balm in Gilead, there is a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician there.</hi> Doeſt thou ſay, Ah but I do not repent? What doeſt thou underſtand
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62919:26"/> by Repentance? Is it not an <hi>hearty</hi> Trouble for them, an hearty Loathing and Deteſtation of them, a Trembling at the very remote Thoughts of them, an hearty deſire to be rid of them; and to entertain them no more: Repentance? What is Repentance then? With what Imaginable colour of Reaſon or Pretence of Scripture, canſt thou charge thy ſelf with the Guilt of that Sin which thou truly Loatheſt, Abhorreſt, Trembleſt at, Studieſt to avoid. And indeed this <hi>Temptation</hi> hath apeared to me, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times converſing with Souls in their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, one of the moſt <hi>Inaccountable Things in the World,</hi> as to the cauſes of it; eſpecially when this <hi>Diſturbance</hi> hath fallen upon Intelligent Souls, acquainted with the Goſpel and the Terms of the Covenant of Grace. For whereas the Devil uſeth this ordinarily but as a praevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Temptation, to enforce another to <hi>Self Murther</hi> or <hi>habituated Deſpair,</hi> one would wonder that any ſuch <hi>Suggeſtions</hi> as theſe, no better entertained, could poſſibly induce the Soul to thoſe other Sins: but ſo it is, upon Experience we find it, that theſe are oft times moſt unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſturbances. It will be therefore worth our while, in the laſt place to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62919:27"/> conſider what may be done, by, or for our Souls, yet at Liberty, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent theſe great incumbrances of our Peace; as alſo for the Relief of thoſe Souls, who (through the permiſſion of a Wiſe God) are fallen under ſuch a tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous Providence as this is: and this is my laſt Work.</p>

What for a preſent Support</hi> and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; but they may both be ſpoken to with the ſame breath: for the ſame <hi>Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> which are proper for the preventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, when remote from us, will alſo be found uſeful for the Support and Conſolation of a Chriſtian groaning under the burthen of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The firſt thing to be done, is for to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the Soul, or for the Soul to prepoſſeſs or perſwade it ſelf, That theſe impreſſions lay it under no guilt before God,</hi> and do not render it unlovely in the ſight of God. <hi>Luther</hi> was an eminent Servant of God, much himſelf exerciſed with temptations and much converſing with thoſe who were ſo exerciſed; It is ſaid of him that he was wont to ſay, That the three things which made a <hi>Divine,</hi> were <hi>Temptation, Meditation</hi> and <hi>Prayer.</hi> In his Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary upon <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. he takes ſpecial no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of this <hi>Tenptation</hi> to <hi>Atheiſtical</hi> and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62919:28"/> 
                  <hi>Blaſphemous Thoughts,</hi> I cannot direct you better than in the words of that great Man of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It often hapeneth <hi>(Luth.</hi> c. 4. p. 4. 34. <hi>Jen. in Pſal.</hi> 90. 1.) ſaith he, and I have ſeen it in many, that when they have diſcerned themſelves exerciſed with theſe thoughts, they have been as men without life: There is therefore a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity they ſhould be governed; and the True Government of them is this, <hi>Ut ſtatuas te non ideo eſſe a Deo abjectum quod iſta ſentis,</hi> for you to determine that you are not rejected of God becauſe of them; for altho there be ſome cauſe of them in us, and they are the fruits of <hi>Original Sin,</hi> yet they are much promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and augmented by the Tempter the Devil. For it often happeneth that the Soul ſincerely and paſſionately deſires to be delivered from them, but it cannot: there, ſaith he, this advice is to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, That the Soul do not, becauſe of them, deſpair. 2. That it oppoſe ſuch thoughts what it can poſſibly, and not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, nor indulge them—For, ſaith he, theſe thoughts are not therefore ſent, for you to judge your ſelf from them; but that you may oppoſe and withſtand them.—When (ſaith he)
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62919:28"/> the Devil hath Tempted us with theſe Blaſphemous Thoughts, he goes on—See, ſaith he, what an Heart you have, Are you not now a grievous Sinner? This the Soul cannot deny. He groweth upon this, God is therefore, ſaith he, very angry with thee: How can God but be angry with ſuch a Blaſphemer? Here, ſaith he, do but yield a little, and he ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth you, and I have known many thus undone.—You muſt therefore govern theſe Thoughts, you muſt oppoſe the Adverſary, and fix your ſelf upon this, <hi>That</hi> God is not diſpleaſed <hi>with you</hi> for theſe Impreſſions and Thoughts, if you do not entertain and indulge them.</q> Thus far that great man. And indeed this is the firſt and great thing to be learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Soul. The Sin of <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> will in an Hour of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (eſpecially) appear ſo great, ſo hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous unto the Soul, that unleſs you can deliver ſuch a Soul from the apprehenſions of ſuch a guilt, all that you can ſay to it will be of little avail. Miniſters and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Chriſtians dealing and treating with Souls in theſe paroxyſmes, ought to lay the great Streſs here, and to make this the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> of their Diſcourſes. What may be ſaid to evince this to the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62919:29"/> Soul I have largely ſhewed you in the former Chapter: Let the thus troubled Soul meditate of thoſe things, and let Experienced Miniſters and Chriſtians add what they can of that nature, and lay the great Streſs here, and they will find all little enough to induce a Soul thus circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to be thus perſwaded; and on the other ſide, if this be done, the Cure is wrought, the Soul will then quickly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> are its work: The more wee can ſhew the Soul of the <hi>Devil</hi> in the Impreſſion, the more it will be frighted from hearkening to, or complying with him, and the more Valiant will the Chriſtian be in this Spiritual Combate: Mind therefore Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians under theſe circumſtances, that Chriſt himſelf was not without ſuch kind of Sinful Impreſſions, yet without Sin: That our firſt Parents in Innocency had them: That it is contrary to what our Saviour hath Taught us to think, that any thing, <hi>That is from without, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into a Man, defileth a Man;</hi> That there is no Law prohibits them. That there being nothing of our own will in them, it is Impoſſible they ſhould be our guilt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But theſe things I have further opened, and enlarged upon in the former Chapter.</p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:62919:29"/>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Indeavour to poſſeſs your ſelves with the trueſt apprehenſions of God you can.</hi> This is good before the hour of Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it will prepare you for the Spiritual Combate; and if you have neglected this before, yet do not neglect it in the hour of Temptation. Here I ſhall onely give you this caution, Take heed of taking your <hi>Notions</hi> of God from <hi>Senſe,</hi> or <hi>meerly</hi> from Reaſon. 1. <hi>Not from Senſe,</hi> Spiritual Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings fall under no cogniſance of the <hi>Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Senſes.</hi> None ever ſaw <hi>Gods Shape,</hi> none ever ſaw his Similitude; and here let me <hi>caution</hi> you, againſt any <hi>Pictures</hi> of God, or any <hi>Perſon</hi> in the <hi>God-head.</hi> We are ready in our minds to form <hi>Idea's</hi> in our minds of any Beings according to the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations, which Pictures and Images make of them. It is Impoſſible but all Pictures, Images, or External repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of the Divine Being, muſt be Teachers of <hi>Lyes.</hi> It is impoſſible that a Limner ſhould draw the true repreſentation of a man whom he never ſaw. How is it poſſible he ſhould draw any repreſentation of an Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible God, a Being which he neither ever ſaw nor can ſee? The faireſt pretence is for the Picture of our Saviour, who aſſumed our nature, and was a man in all things. But all thoſe Pictures muſt be Teachers of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62919:30"/> lies too: For Chriſt was God-Man, and the repreſentation of a Man is no repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Perſon of the <hi>Mediatour.</hi> Doth any ſay that upon the ſame Argument there ſhould be no <hi>Pictures</hi> drawn, for a <hi>Picture</hi> doth but repreſent our <hi>Fleſhly Part,</hi> the <hi>Soul</hi> cannot be expreſſed. I anſwer there yet are theſe differences: 1. The <hi>Picture of our friend is the repreſentation of a being that we know is or was informed with a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Soul,</hi> ſo as the other eſſential part of the man, is on courſe underſtood; but it is not ſo as to Chriſt. Tho the <hi>Picture of an humane Shape</hi> hath this advantage, that we may underſtand under it a reaſonable Soul, of which every man is poſſeſſed, yet we cannot under any ſuch Shape underſtand the Divine Nature <hi>perſonally united to the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature.</hi> 2. Again, Even the Picture of a man, if it hath no ſimilitude of the man, is but a <hi>Teacher of a lie,</hi> and doth but help our thoughts with falſe notions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions. And what <hi>Limner</hi> ever ſaw the Lord in his Humane Shape, to draw a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of him? What need any Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of Chriſt, when every man we ſee, is as true a repreſentation of him, as any Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner can make, who never ſaw him in the fleſh, nor a true Copy to draw him by. I am apt to believe that this was one
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62919:30"/> Reaſon of Gods ſo ſevere <hi>prohibition of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages</hi> and the <hi>Likeneſs of any thing</hi> to repreſent God; becauſe he knew that thoſe things would be of this pernicious uſe, to give us falſe notions and <hi>Idea's</hi> of God: for you ſhall obſerve when you have ſeen the pretended Picture, or reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of a Man, you will fancy him according to that <hi>Repreſentation,</hi> whether the Picture be any thing like the <hi>Perſon</hi> for whom it is made, yea or no. 3. To which I might add, That admitting a <hi>Picture of a Man, or a Friend,</hi> be not like the <hi>Perſon,</hi> and give our Fancies a falſe Notion of him, yet in this there <hi>is no Sin,</hi> no <hi>Defilement,</hi> no Guilt upon the Soul by it; but to <hi>Conceive amiſs of God</hi> is a thing quite of another Nature and of further danger to the Soul. This hath made me ſometimes wonder, that <hi>Luther,</hi> tho he abhorred Images, and ſhewed as great a deteſtation of them as any other, as they are uſed in <hi>Popery,</hi> as they are means or objects of Adoration; yet allowed the uſe and ſtanding of them in <hi>Churches.</hi> Certainly it is a thing of very dangerous conſequence, whether in Churches or our own private Houſes; for we ſhall find a great proneneſs in us to <hi>form out Notions of God according to ſuch repreſentations;</hi> and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62919:31"/> if thoſe repreſentations be lies, and falſe, ſuch will our <hi>Notions</hi> be: and if this be not a fair way to fill the Soul with <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemous Thoughts</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God and Chriſt, I do not know what is.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, Take heed of taking your <hi>Notions of God from Reaſon.</hi> Reaſon is a power within us, by which we make Concluſions from ſome Principles. Now theſe Principles are either Connatural to us, and bred in, and with us; or ſuch as we have from <hi>Revelation.</hi> Reaſon working upon Connate Natural Principles, will much convince us, that <hi>there is a God,</hi> and ſhew us alſo ſomething what manner of Being God muſt be. Nature will tell us that nothing is the cauſe of it ſelf, and will lead us to a <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi> a firſt Being, a firſt Cauſe, a firſt Mover; and will teach us, That whoſoever is the Cauſe of any Excellency or Perfection in another by his Communication of it, if he loſeth nothing by that Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, muſt needs have that Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Excellency in a more Eminent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in himſelf. But alas the <hi>Divine Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> is Infinitely above the Fathom and Comprehenſion of <hi>Humane Reaſon,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding only from Connate and Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Principles. There is an Excellent uſe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62919:31"/> of Reaſon to give us the true Notion of God: That is by ſetting it on Work, to conclude from <hi>Principles of Revelation;</hi> Firſt firmly Believing whatever is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in Holy Writ, then uſing our Reaſon both to compare <hi>Scripture with Scripture,</hi> to find out the true Revelation, the true ſenſe and meaning of Holy Writ; and to ſhew us that what the Scripture revealeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God, is but what Reaſon will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low may be.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But the Sureſt Way for Perſons to come to a true Notion of God, is <hi>to attend to what the Scripture ſaith,</hi> to Believe concerning God, whatſoever we find there. No man hath ſeen God at any time, no Reaſon is able to Comprehend an Infinite Being, and the Perfections of it, but the Son of God, and the Holy Spirit of God. They have Revealed God, and thence we muſt take thoſe Meaſures of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of God, which we are capable of, till we come to <hi>ſee him as he is,</hi> and to <hi>know him as we are known.</hi> Let it be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Care of every Chriſtian from thoſe Sacred Writings to poſeſs himſelf of due Notions and juſt Apprehenſions of the Divine Being. A Chriſtian ſhall find theſe three Eminent Advantages of this Knowledge according to the Meaſure we are Capable of.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:62919:32"/>1. <hi>There is no ſuch Director of our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and External Homage to God, as a juſt Notion of the Divine Being.</hi> Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Apprehenſions of his <hi>Majeſty, Power, Greatneſs,</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> ſo ſhall we <hi>Adore, Revere,</hi> and <hi>Fear him:</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Apprehenſions of his <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> ſo we ſhall <hi>Love him,</hi> Breath after him, and <hi>Delight</hi> in him. According to our Apprehenſions of his <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Fidelity,</hi> ſo ſhall we <hi>Confide,</hi> and <hi>Truſt in him.</hi> If we truly Apprehend him as a <hi>Spirit,</hi> we ſhall Conclude he muſt be Worſhipped with our <hi>Spirits,</hi> and that all <hi>Noiſes</hi> and <hi>Exteriour pretended Homa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> (if not expreſly commanded by him) are indeed no Homage to him, but ſome fooliſh Acts of <hi>Voluntary Humility,</hi> and that all <hi>Lip Labour,</hi> all <hi>Bodily Homage,</hi> ſeperated from the Internal Homage, Attention, and Intention of the Soul, and its Stooping before him, are of no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail; being no preportionable Homage to a Spiritual Being in the Eye of Reaſon, nor required by him at all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>There is no</hi> ſuch <hi>Antidote</hi> as <hi>this againſt the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> of Erroneous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and Opinions.</hi> We have abroad many Erroneous Doctrines relating to the great Truths of God, if they be ſearched
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62919:32"/> to the bottom, you will find them ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up out of a falſe Apprehenſion and Conception of the Nature of God. It were eaſie to ſhew you how a <hi>due Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg</hi> and Conception of God, will fortify the Soul againſt many Errors. But,</p>
               <p n="3">3. Laſtly, <hi>There is no ſuch Weapon to repel theſe Fiery Darts,</hi> of which I am ſpeaking. A Soul is not ſoon diſpoſſeſt of ſuch No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God, as it is once well rooted in; and eſpecially when it is rooted in them upon the Authority, the <hi>Infallible Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a Divine Revelation.</hi> It is good therefore for Chriſtians, before any ſuch Temptations come upon them, to be well Inſtructed concerning the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Attributes of God,</hi> and to entertain no Notions but ſuch as ſhall be confirmed unto him from Scriptures; nor is any thing of more Advantage to a Soul in an hour of ſuch great Temptations, than to Read, and have Read to him, Diſcourſes of this nature; ſuch eſpecialy as are moſt Scriptural, and indeavour to Eſtabliſh the Faith of Chriſtians, not in or by the wiſdom of men, but the Power of God. Let this be a Second Direction.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, <hi>Let no Soul under theſe Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, forbear Reading the Scriptures and waiting upon God in the hearing of his</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:62919:33"/> 
                  <hi>Word.</hi> I have often obſerved and lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the great Conqueſt which the Devil ordinarily getteth over Souls under this as well as other great Temptations, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading them to forbear Reading and Hearing the Word of God. <hi>Luther</hi> tells us, That it is the Devils great Art,—<hi>Ut nos abducat ab oratione et verbo ut ſic nudos ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grediatur ac vincat.</hi> To draw us off from the Word, that ſo he may ſet upon us diſarmed, and make a Conqueſt of us. The Word of God is the <hi>Sword of the Spirit,</hi> if the Devil can get us off from that, he hath taken our Sword from us; the Preaching of the Word (I mean when it is Preached plainly and faithfully, that Chriſtians do not meerly hear <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Words of Men puffed up with the Idle Conceits of their own Rhethorick or Logick) is Gods great Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, with which he concurreth, and where he is preſent. And this I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in Experience, when any Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans under theſe violences, have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to go out and to hear the Word, they have ordinarily found thoſe their freeſt Hours; tho it may be the Temptation hath afterwards returned: I know Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans under theſe Circumſtances find a great ſtrife with themſelves, and go out with ſome
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62919:33"/> difficulty to hear Sermons; but I never but knew a good effect of their going, either for a ſhorter, or a more laſting Relief.</p>
               <p>4. Fourthly, <hi>Let Chriſtians under theſe Circumſtances,</hi> and not then <hi>onely, but at all times, avoid any communion or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with Atheiſtical and Blaſphemous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or Reading or looking upon any A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſtical and Blaſphemous Books.</hi> Thoughts you know engender in us by Reflexion upon what we <hi>ſee</hi> or <hi>hear,</hi> or elſe they are <hi>bred</hi> by the workings of our own Minds, without ſuch Aids and Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances. Oh beware of theſe things as the Bane and Poyſon of thy Soul; do what thou canſt, thy Mind will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving, thy Thoughts will be roling upon what thou haſt <hi>ſeen, read,</hi> or <hi>heard.</hi> Avoid therefore <hi>Atheiſtical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Blaſphemous Company.</hi> What know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou how farr God will leave thee, when thou haſt run thy ſelf into a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation.</p>
               <p>5. Fifthly, <hi>If any ſuch Thoughts ariſe in thy Heart, give them no entertainment.</hi> Chide them down, turn thy mind to ſome other Objects, do not give them place for an hour, no if it be poſſible not for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; theſe Cockatrices are beſt cruſh'd
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62919:34"/> in the Egg. Allow no parly with no ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or deliberation upon, or with a Thought derogatory to the Majeſty on high, to the Honour and Glory of the great God.</p>
               <p>6. Sixthly, <hi>If thou beeſt already under the preſſure of theſe Thoughts, give thy ſelf all lawful Diverſion thou canſt.</hi> There is a Religious <hi>Diverſion,</hi> by <hi>Reading, Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Prayer,</hi> which beſides the Diverſion that is in them, are thy Duties, Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God; but there are alſo Civil Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of <hi>Worldly Buſineſs, Moderate Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations.</hi> Some of the former I have already adviſed, and ſhall by and by ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the other: But allow thy ſelf alſo theſe other <hi>Diverſions,</hi> better it is for thee to be doing any thing that is lawful, than ſitting ſtill and doing nothing but afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and tormenting thy ſelf, and yielding up thy ſelf entirely to the Conduct and Governance, and Suggeſtions of thy grand Adverſary.</p>
               <p>7. Seventhly, Be much in the company of <hi>Faithful Miniſters</hi> and <hi>Good Chriſtians,</hi> ſuch eſpecially as are knowing and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced; as the Lips of Wicked <hi>Men talk of Miſchief;</hi> Pro. 24. 2. and as the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſaith, <hi>Swallow up themſelves</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers alſo, ſo the <hi>Lips of Knowledge are a precious Jewel;</hi> Pro. 20. 15. they diſperſe
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62919:34"/> Knowledge; <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 7. They <hi>feed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;</hi> Prov. 10. 21. Yea and they Heal ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. It is a Saying of <hi>Luther</hi> (in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned place, <hi>Ingens eſt pondus in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo fratris quod tempore periculi ex Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pturâ pronuntiatur:</hi> There is a great Weight even in a private Chriſtians Words pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced <hi>from Scripture.</hi> The healing is in the <hi>Divine Word,</hi> let it come to thee through what <hi>Vehicle</hi> it will; ſometimes it pleaſeth God, that it ſhould come out of the Word as running through the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> Lips. He is Gods Ordinance. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, as running out of the private <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> Lips: Private Chriſtians, are alſo a more private Ordinance of God, for the <hi>Admonition</hi> of thoſe that are running into danger, the reſtoring of ſuch as are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, the comforting of thoſe that are ſad, and the ſtrengthening of thoſe that are weak.</p>
               <p>8. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Let all ſuch as are under this Temptation <hi>be much in Faſting and Prayer. Prayer</hi> is an Univerſal Remedy for all <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils:</hi> Our Saviour hath told us there is a kind of <hi>Divils,</hi> that goeth not out but <hi>by Faſting and Prayer;</hi> and becauſe for the moſt part Chriſtians under theſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances are not ſo fit for <hi>Solemn Prayers</hi> as others are, let them here call in the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62919:35"/> help of <hi>Miniſters and good Chriſtians,</hi> whom they may reaſonably think have an Intereſt in, and a Power with God, and ſhall prevail; who can take hold of the Lords Strength, and ask him with Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs concerning the Works of his Hands; and will not let the Lord go until he bleſſeth them. The hand of <hi>Joab,</hi> the <hi>hand of the Devil</hi> is in this thing, and the ſtrong man keepeth the houſe until a ſtronger than he cometh; and the Devil hath no Superiour but the Almighty. In this Caſe therefore all Friends of ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are highly concerned to get Prayers for them, Solemn Prayers; for the Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is exceeding heavy, none more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable, none more intollerable: My ſelf have known it as to two iſſues, in the deſtroying of themſelves, not able to ſtand under the burthen of it; tho as to ſeveral I have known it have a better Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue. I onely tell you this, to mind you to be more careful, more concerned, and to neglect no Natural, Moral, or Spiritual Means.</p>
               <p>I muſt Confeſs the Regular Method of Curing Spiritual, as well as Natural Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, is by <hi>removing the Cauſe;</hi> but as in ſome Natural Diſtempers it is not eaſie to find out the true Cauſe, which
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62919:35"/> makes the Cure difficult, ſo neither is it eaſie to find out the true cauſe here: <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy</hi> is one Cauſe of ſeveral Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of the Soul, diſpoſing a perſon to more Thoughtfulneſs and Seriouſneſs, to more Fears and Jealouſies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Black Thoughts concerning our ſelves; whence it is not hard to conceive how Perſons in whom that prevaileth to a great Exceſs (if before they have ever minded their Souls and their Eternal Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt) ſhould by it be diſpoſed to <hi>Exceſſive Fears</hi> and <hi>Deſperate Thoughts,</hi> as to their <hi>Eternal State,</hi> but it is hard to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, how the prevalence of that or any other peccant Bodily Humour ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe Perſons to <hi>Atheiſtical, or Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Thoughts</hi> of, or againſt God; fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then that it may run Perſons into a Deliration: ſo as beeing broke looſe from the Conduct and Government of Reaſon, they ſhall think and talk any thing. Nor were it difficult to give ſome account of this <hi>Temptation,</hi> if we could find that ſuch alone fell under it, as formerly were Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of <hi>Atheiſtical Principles</hi> or <hi>Lives.</hi> God as to ſuch might be reaſonably thought to give them up to a <hi>Reprobate Mind,</hi> and <hi>Underſtanding:</hi> but we upon Experience find, that they are very often
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62919:36"/> the grievences of Pious and Devout Souls, who have lived a life in a daily Dread and Holy Reverence of God; and as to ſuch, what Account further to give of them, then, <hi>That they are heavy Trials, with which it pleaſeth the Wiſe God ſometimes to Exerciſe his Deareſt People,</hi> I cannot tell.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>The Text 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 15. opened ſhortly. How far the Sin of Murther extendeth, beyond what is puniſhable by the Judge, To the Killer of himſelf, as well as to the Killer of others. In what Senſe. No Murtherer hath Eternal Life. Two things understood by Eternal Life. Whether it be in no caſe lawful for one to kill himſelf? That it is not, proved by Four Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments. Whether no perſon,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62919:37"/> that hath Eternal Life in the Seed (being born of God) or ſhall have it in the Fruit, can kill himſelf. Six Concluſions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving that Caſe. One that killeth himſelf directly may have Eternal Life. One that mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth himſelf cannot. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of thoſe two Expreſſions.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Apoſtle, 1 <hi>John.</hi> 3. 15. deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineth thus, <hi>Whoſoever hateth his Brother, is a Murtherer, and you know that no Murtherer hath Eternal Life abiding in him.</hi> It is onely the later part of that verſe which I ſhall concern my ſelf in, not intending to conſider the <hi>Sin of Murther,</hi> ſo far as it relateth unto our <hi>Brother,</hi> but as it relateth to our ſelves; and the ſame Perſon may be both the <hi>Murtherer,</hi> and the <hi>Murthered,</hi> and the Apoſtle concluding generally <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Every Murtherer hath not; or no Murtherer hath Eternal Life in himſelf;</hi> (for they are Equipollent Phraſes) gives me this liberty. Though <hi>the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer</hi> he is ſpeaking of in this Text, is the <hi>Murtherer of his Brother,</hi> and that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62919:37"/> 
                  <hi>but in his Heart,</hi> by a <hi>rooted inveterate Hatred:</hi> The <hi>Propoſition of</hi> this Text is plainly this, <hi>That no Murtherer hath E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life abiding in him;</hi> In the Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of which here are two <hi>Terms</hi> to be Opened. 1. <hi>Who is a Murtherer. 2. In what Senſe it is ſaid, That no Murtherer hath Eternal Life in himſelf.</hi> As to the firſt I ſhall conclude,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>Murther according to the Law of God, extendeth much farther, then it is or can be enquired, of, or puniſhed by the Law of Man.</hi> This appeareth evidently from the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in this place, where he ſaith that, <hi>He who hateth his Brother, is a Murtherer;</hi> no <hi>Law of Man</hi> ſaith ſo, nor proportioneth a Puniſhment to the <hi>Secret Motions of the Heart,</hi> but the Law of God doth: Hence our Saviour correcting the <hi>Phariſees</hi> in Interpretation of the Law of God, and in <hi>juſtification</hi> of himſelf, that he came not to <hi>deſtroy</hi> it, but to <hi>fulfil it,</hi> begins with the giving the Senſe of this Commandement far different from what the <hi>Phariſees</hi> had given, <hi>Matth. 5. 20, 21. You have heard that it hath been ſaid by them of old time, you ſhall not kill; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever kills, ſhall be guilty of the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But I ſay unto you that whoſoever is angry with his Brother without a cauſe,</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:62919:38"/> 
                  <hi>ſhall be in danger of the Judgment: and whoſoever ſhall ſay unto his Brother</hi> Raca, <hi>ſhall be in danger of the Council: But who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall ſay,</hi> Thou Fool, <hi>ſhall be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Hell-fire.</hi> From theſe two <hi>Texts</hi> appears, that by the <hi>Law of God,</hi> not onely he who actually <hi>ſheddeth Mans Blood without a juſt cauſe, and putteth a period to his days;</hi> but he <hi>who entertaineth in his heart any thoughts, purpoſes, or deſigns, any deliberations, or gives conſent to ſuch a thing, he who takes a pleaſure in any ſuch thoughts, or entertaineth</hi> any. Affection <hi>or Paſſion conducing to ſuch an end, or uſeth any means towards it, is a Murtherer.</hi> Upon this account St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>he that hateth his Brother, is a Murtherer.</hi> Now the Law of Man that onely judgeth of <hi>overt Acts,</hi> and determineth him onely a <hi>Murtherer,</hi> that <hi>wilfully, and without due Authority, doth take away the life of another.</hi> The Text in <hi>St. John</hi> muſt be neceſſarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended further.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, According to the Laws of Men as well as the Laws of God, <hi>He</hi> who <hi>wilfully,</hi> and <hi>without due Authority, putteth an end to his own Life,</hi> is a <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, as well as he who ſo taketh away the Life of another.</hi> The Law ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not bear falſe Witneſs againſt thy Neighbour;</hi>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:62919:38"/> but it ſays, <hi>Thou ſhalt do no Murther,</hi> in timating that a Man may be guilty of Murther by <hi>Murthering himſelf,</hi> as well as by <hi>taking away the Life of his Neighbour.</hi> And the <hi>Laws of Men</hi> do ſo adjudge it, though the Puniſhment due to <hi>Murther</hi> cannot be inflicted on one already dead, yet they order <hi>Shame and Ignominy, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of Goods, Ignominious Burial,</hi> to teſtifie their Judgment of the Fact: And indeed the Law. of the Second Table be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt <hi>Violations</hi> of <hi>Charity,</hi> and for the maintaining Charity, and preventing the <hi>Violations</hi> of, and <hi>Breaches</hi> upon <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Society,</hi> it is unreaſonable to think, That this <hi>Charity</hi> ſhould not begin at our ſelves, and that we ſhould not be under higher Obligations to preſerve our own Lives than the Lives of our Neighbours; as much obliged not to deface the Image of God upon our ſelves, as upon others. Which is the reaſon that God himſelf giveth of his firſt Precept to <hi>Noah</hi> againſt Murther, <hi>Gen. 9. 6. Whoſo ſheddeth Mans Blood, by Man ſhall his Blood be ſhed; for in the Image of God made he Man:</hi> So then the <hi>Murtherer</hi> in Scripture Senſe is, <hi>That Man or Woman who wilfully, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any juſt cauſe, or due Authority, putteth an end to his own Life, or the Life of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62919:39"/> or who nouriſheth in his Heart, any Purpoſe, Deſign, or Deliberation, or Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of that tendency, or ſpeaketh any Words of that tendency, or doth any Action tending to it, though it be not perfective of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From this Notion of <hi>Murther,</hi> and <hi>Murtherers,</hi> evidently appeareth that two ſorts of Perſons are not to be charged with this great Guilt. 1. <hi>Such as are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of Death unto others</hi> in a <hi>juſt War,</hi> or in times of Peace, <hi>at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Magiſtrate in the Execution of Juſtice;</hi> when Men for their Crimes are righteouſly adjudged to Death, and Perſons are commanded to execute the Sentence: <hi>Nor ſuch who (intending no ſuch thing) by accident, and againſt their Wills, are occaſion of Death either to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or others:</hi> This we uſually call <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter,</hi> not <hi>Murther.</hi> Nor ſuch who <hi>in their own juſt defence are forced to kill others,</hi> ſuppoſe Robbers <hi>by the High-way,</hi> or breaking into <hi>our Houſes.</hi> God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf determined this, <hi>Exod. 22. 2. If a Thief be found breaking up, and be ſmitten that he die, there ſhall no Blood be ſhed for him. If the Sun be riſen there ſhall be Blood ſhed.</hi> The Reaſon of that is, becauſe then help might have been called in, and he taken;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62919:39"/> and by the Law of God, he was to <hi>make Reſtitution;</hi> or if he had nothing, he was to be ſold for his Theft; as you read there, v. 3. So that the killing of him was not neceſſary for the defence of him that was robbed: But my deſign is not to handle the Caſes relating to <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> of another, nor indeed any of them, onely to ſpeak to <hi>Self-Murther:</hi> Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Text ſaith, <hi>No Murtherer hath Eternal Life.</hi> We have heard the Subject, let me open the <hi>Praedicate,</hi> and ſhew in what Senſe the <hi>Propoſition</hi> is true, <hi>That no Murtherer hath Eternal Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>Eternal Life</hi> is to be conſidered, either, <hi>In the Firſt Fruits of it, or the fuller Harveſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. In the <hi>Firſt Fruits,</hi> and ſo it muſt be conſidered here, or elſe we muſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit an <hi>Enallage</hi> of the <hi>Preſent Tenſe</hi> for the <hi>Future,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; and not onely ſo, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo limit the Senſe of it to the Future (for which I ſee no reaſon at all.) For take <hi>Eternal Life</hi> as it ſignifieth the happy State of Souls after the Reſurrection, <hi>in the Beatifical Viſion of God;</hi> ſo no one alive hath Eternal Life. Eternal Life therefore in the firſt place <hi>ſignifieth,</hi> That <hi>ſpecial Effectual Grace of God, which will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly bring the Soul to Eternal Life.</hi> That
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62919:40"/> which he before called the <hi>Seed of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding</hi> in the Soul. And that will bring in a Queſtion (to which I may poſſibly ſpeak ſomething by and by) <hi>Whether an Elect Soul, that is called and ſanctified, may not fall into this Sin?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. But 2dly. Eternal Life is alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable in the <hi>full Harveſt,</hi> as it ſignifieth the <hi>Bleſſed Eſtate of the Soul in the Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical Viſion of God;</hi> and ſo it is true <hi>no Murtherer,</hi> none that dieth under the Actual Guilt of Murther, not repented of, not removed from him, ſhall ſee God; and to this purpoſe is that, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 8. where <hi>Murtherers</hi> are reckoned amongſt thoſe <hi>who ſhall have their part in the Lake that burneth with Fire and Brimſtone,</hi> which is the Second Death; and that brings in a Second Queſtion, <hi>Whether a Murtherer cannot be ſaved?</hi> But before I can ſpeak any thing to theſe, it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, I ſhould ſpeak ſomething to a more Origiinal Queſtion, with reference to this Sin.</p>
               <div type="case">
                  <head>
                     <hi>Caſe.</hi> Whether it be not lawful for a Perſon in any Caſe to Kill him or her ſelf?</head>
                  <p>It is plain from the reading of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaner Hiſtory, that diverſe of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, yea ſome of their <hi>Philoſophers,</hi>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:62919:40"/> did not think it <hi>unlawful for Men and Women to kill themſelves,</hi> but thought it in ſome Caſes their Duty. In Caſe of their <hi>Countrey,</hi> or <hi>Friends, under great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances of Mind</hi> or <hi>Preſſures of Bodily Afflictions,</hi> &amp;c. but even amongſt them there were a wiſer, and ſo underſtanding part, <hi>who</hi> from their Light of Reaſon ſaw better things; for even they would ſometimes diſpute, <hi>That it was no Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Valour or Fortitude, but of a baſe, and impotent and cowardly Mind,</hi> that durſt not encounte with a little pain or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and <hi>that we were ſet in this World by our great Commander,</hi> the Lord of all, as Souldiers in a Rank and File, which we muſt not break out of, but by order and direction from him; and that <hi>it was an injury to the Kingdom or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth wherein we lived,</hi> and ſuch like. But we have ſurer Rule to guid us by; to wit, the holy Scriptures. <hi>And the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulneſs of it upon any pretence whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> is determined by all Divines, both Ancient and Modern, that are of any va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue; and that for theſe Reaſons:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Law of God is expreſs, <hi>Thou ſhalt do no Murther,</hi> and that Precept is not to be limited to the Murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of others; for the Law of God doth
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62919:41"/> not ſay, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill thy Neighhour:</hi> but, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill: it</hi> muſt indeed be reſtrained to Men and Women, for God hath given us a Liberty, as to Beaſts to <hi>Kill and Eat,</hi> nor is the Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Brute and Irrational Creatures,</hi> but ſuch as are <hi>Rational,</hi> and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtinction; Now he that <hi>killeth</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf doth <hi>kill:</hi> Again, the Law in the General Scope of it, commandeth <hi>Charity;</hi> now we ought in the firſt place to be <hi>Charitable</hi> to our ſelves; <hi>Murther,</hi> ſay <hi>Caſuiſts, is the Killing of a</hi> Man <hi>without Authority.</hi> Now this he doth, who killeth himſelf, for none is <hi>ſuperior</hi> to himſelf, none hath Authority over himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again (ſaith <hi>Jiliucius</hi> one of the Popiſh Caſuiſts (who yet though many of them give ſtrange liberty to Men to <hi>kill others,</hi> yet few or none give Men liberty to kill themſelves.) <hi>To kill a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can be lawful but in two Cauſes: 1. For our own Defence,</hi> ſo a Perſon may kill one aſſaulting him, breaking into his Houſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or, 2. <hi>For Execution of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Sentence</hi> of <hi>Juſtice.</hi> But none can kill himſelf in his <hi>own Defence,</hi> nor be a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate to himſelf,</hi> to Judge, Sentence, or Condemn himſelf; ſo that ſay they it can be lawful in no Caſe for Men to put an end to their own Lives.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:62919:41"/>3. Again, They argue truly <hi>from a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Enumeration of the ſuppoſed Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant Cauſes that ſhould juſtifie ſuch a Fact,</hi> ſhewing the <hi>Invalidity</hi> of them. We read of one of the Heathens, who having got a dark Notion of an <hi>Eternal State,</hi> would put an end to his Life, that he might <hi>the ſooner be in poſſeſſion of it. But this is not the way to Eternal Life.</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>No Murtherer hath Eternal Life.</hi> Eternal Life is the gift of God, and he gives it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Revealed Will, and his Reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Will is, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 8. That <hi>Murtherers</hi> ſhould <hi>have their Portion in the Lake which burneth with Fire and Brimſtone,</hi> and this is the Second Death. A Second Cauſe (which the Heathen aſſigned as) juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant of Self-Murther, was, <hi>To avoid the Violence of others;</hi> ſuppoſe Perſecutors or Mutherers. But this cannot juſtifie, For what harm can the injuries or violence of others do us? Saith <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> A Third Cauſe ſome aſſign, or pretend, is, To <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void Sin for the time to come.</hi> To prevent their further diſhonouring of God. But this were <hi>to do evil, that good might come of it;</hi> and to prejudge our ſelves, and deny Gods Mercy to Back-ſliders. A Fourth Cauſe aſſigned, is, <hi>To take revenge upon our ſelves for past Sins.</hi> But who made
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62919:42"/> us Judges and Revengers in the Caſe? And ſurely paſt Sins are better waſhed by the <hi>Blood of Chriſt,</hi> and the Water of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. The laſt and indeed moſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and true Cauſe, is, To <hi>avoid Shame and Ignominy, to deliver our ſelves from horrors and terrors of Conſcience, or other miſeries.</hi> But the very Heathen condemned this, as the Indication of an <hi>Impotent Cowardly Spirit, of an haſty and impatient Spirit:</hi> Where is the Faith and Patience of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, if this were lawful? But I ſhall have occaſion in the ſequel of this Diſcourſe further to ſhew the exceeding vanity of theſe Pretences for the juſtification of ſo horrid a Fact.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Again, <hi>It is a Sin againſt the Light and Law of Nature. No man yet ever ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his own Fleſh.</hi> Nature it ſelf, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucht nor diſordered, ſaith to every one <hi>Spare thy Self.</hi> There cannot be a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Violence offered to our <hi>Nature</hi> ſurely, than to deſtroy it. To ſhut up this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe (there being few that ſtand in need of this Conviction, who are in an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way capable of it.) Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> a <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Caſuiſt</hi> of our own, concludes it a Sin againſt <hi>Nature, Piety, Juſtice, Charity.</hi> Of the firſt I have ſpoken. It appeareth to be againſt <hi>Piety,</hi> as being againſt <hi>the</hi>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:62919:42"/> 
                     <hi>Authority of God,</hi> who alone hath <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> in his Hand, and hath the <hi>Power of our Lives.</hi> 2. Againſt the <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God,</hi> from Him, and of his <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs we live,</hi> and the upholding our Souls in Life, ought to be acknowledged to God as a great Piece of the Divine Goodneſs and Mercy to us. 3. Againſt the <hi>Providence of God</hi> in the Government of the World, diſturbing that Order which he hath ſet. A Sin <hi>againſt Juſtice;</hi> which will not allow any perſon to rob or ſpoil the Kingdom or Common-wealth in which he is a Member, at his pleaſure. Againſt <hi>Charity</hi> (ſaith he) which ought to begin at our ſelves, and by which we are firſt obliged to preſerve our own lives; and then the lives of others. From theſe and ſuch like Arguments, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines do reaſonably conclude, That <hi>Self-murther</hi> is in all Caſes <hi>Sinful,</hi> in no Caſe <hi>Lawful,</hi> nor by any Pretence Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable.</p>
                  <p>The next queſtion is, 2. Qu. <hi>Whether it be to that degree ſinful, as that no Soul that hath received the Grace of God, can commit it?</hi> And 3. Qu. <hi>Whether no Soul that doth commit it, can have Eternal Life, can be ſaved?</hi> Both theſe ſeem to make up the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi>'s Senſe, when he ſaith, <hi>We know that no Murtherer hath Eternal Life.</hi>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:62919:43"/> I will ſpeak to them both together in ſome few Concluſions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Con.</hi> It is very hard to ſay, <hi>What Sin, one that belongeth to the Election of Grace, yea one who is called with an holy Calling, and in a State of Grace; and who ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be ſaved, may not commit.</hi> You know into what Sins, <hi>Lot, Noah, David</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> fell in an hour of very high and great Temptation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Con.</hi> In particular, <hi>Such a perſon may be the actual Murtherer of another: Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was ſo. I mean by <hi>Actual,</hi> not that he immediately committed it, but as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra-diſtinguiſhed to murtherous habits in the Heart; in the Senſe that St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>He who hateth his Brother is a Murtherer.</hi> This is plain in the Caſe of <hi>David.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Con.</hi> Such a <hi>Murtherer</hi> cannot have the <hi>Seed of God</hi> (at that time) <hi>working and abiding in him, nor upon ſuch a fact, have a proximate Right to Eternal Life.</hi> This is plain, for <hi>Murthers</hi> are no <hi>fruits of the Spirit</hi> but of the <hi>Fleſh; Gal.</hi> 5. 21. And no perſon under the guilt of Sin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Repentance</hi> and the <hi>renewed exerciſe of Faith,</hi> can either have any <hi>Sight of his Grace,</hi> or any <hi>Proximate Right to Eternal Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Con.</hi> It is poſſible, That ſuch a
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62919:43"/> great Sinner, as the <hi>Murthererer of another,</hi> may be <hi>renewed by Repentance</hi> and <hi>Faith, and ſo may obtain Everlaſting Life.</hi> This appeareth both by the Promiſe, and alſo by thoſe Preſidents of Free Grace which the Holy Scrtptures do furniſh us with, that we may have Conſolation: For the Promiſe it is made to all <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemy;</hi> Matth. 12. 31. <hi>David</hi> was a Murtherer, ſo was <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>It is poſſible, That a man may be in a Juſtified and Sanctified Eſtate, and may put an end to his own Life, and yet not be a Self-murtherer:</hi> That is, now ſuppoſing him diſtracted, and in a fit of <hi>Frenzy,</hi> not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding what he doth: This man is now not to be judged a Murtherer of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, his Act is not a Rational Humane Act; and doubtleſs ſhall not be imputed to him. This may happen in high Feavors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Suppoſing a Sanctified Perſon to be in the uſe of his Reaſon, (though not perfectly) in a great meaſure able to guid his actions by the conduct of it; he cannot do any ſuch action: The Grace of God working or ſtiring in him. Nor obtain Eternal Life, without Repentance of it; for which he can have but very little time, if any at all.</hi> And this I take to be the Apoſtle's Senſe, when he ſaith, That no
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62919:44"/> Murtherer <hi>hath Eternal Life abiding in him. 1. He hath no true Grace working or acting in him. 2. In that State of Guilt, without true Repentance</hi> (for which he hath little or no time) <hi>he dying, cannot be ſaved. 3. He can have no proximate Right to Eternal Life.</hi> I ſhall add further, That I find no great difficulty to determine, <hi>That a perſon in the uſe of his Reaſon, killing himſelf out-right and preſently, cannot be ſaved.</hi> Men may offer ſuch violence to themſelves, as they may not preſently die by the Act they have done in order to it; ſo as they may have time to <hi>repent</hi> and be received to Mercy (that made me put in the word [outright, forthwith] and there is no Sin that is upon a True Repentance unpardonable. They may do it in a <hi>Deliration</hi> or <hi>Diſtraction,</hi> when they are not under the guidance and conduct of their Reaſon, and then it is not an Humane Act. But ſuppoſing their Act to be an <hi>Humane, Rational Act,</hi> and ſo effectually done, as it leaveth no <hi>breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time for Repentance;</hi> I cannot ſee a poſſibility of Salvation in ſuch a Caſe. I can eaſily agree it, that every one who <hi>killeth himſelf,</hi> doth not <hi>murther him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> Poſſibly a man does an <hi>Action,</hi> or makes ſome <hi>Omiſſion,</hi> by the doing or the omitting of which he dies; but he never
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62919:44"/> deſigned, never intended it; but poſſibly hoped for a quite contrary effect, of ſuch Action or Omiſſion. Such a one may be ſaid to have killed himſelf, but not to have murthered himſelf. Nay although a perſon had no ſuch intention contrary, but by his miſtake, what he deſigned for good to himſelf, iſſueth in ſuch an effect; yet he may be no <hi>Self-murtherer: becauſe not under the perfect guidance of his Reaſon.</hi> Suppoſe a Child, or a Fool and Natural Ideot, which neither of them are guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their Reaſon, ſhould do ſuch Acts, I think they oughe not to be concluded <hi>Murtherers.</hi> The Caſe is the ſame of <hi>Frenetick</hi> and <hi>Diſtracted Perſons.</hi> Suppoſe in a <hi>Violent Feavour</hi> or a <hi>Frenzy,</hi> occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned ſome other way, a perſon ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him or her ſelf; I would be very tender of concluding ſuch a perſon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this guilt. The difficulteſt Caſe ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to me to be in the Caſe of that <hi>partial Deliration</hi> which we ſee often cauſed from <hi>Melancholy;</hi> and is commonly attended with <hi>violent impulſes from Satan.</hi> The Queſtion is, Suppoſing <hi>perſons under theſe circumſtances do deſtroy themſelves, what is to be determined concerning their Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing State?</hi> If they offer ſuch violence to themſelves, as doth not produce death pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62919:45"/> but gives them a time for Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, the Determination will be beſt founded upon our ſight of their Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, upon the reprieve which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God giveth them: Whether they heartily repent of ſuch attempts, and be ſerious in asking pardon at Gods hands, yea or no. If the attempt hath ſuch a ſpeedy iſſue in Death, as leaves no room or place for this. That which is to be conſidered, is, <hi>How they before were, in what poſſeſſion of Reaſon, under what vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of Impulſes;</hi> which may induce us to believe the action not <hi>deliberate</hi> and <hi>voluntary.</hi> And truly where ſuch an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy iſſue ſhutteth up a precedent Holy Life, ſpent in a fear and dread of God, an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of Sin, a deſire to walk in the Commandments of God, and that for ſome good ſpace of time;</hi> I ſhould be apt to judg very <hi>charitably:</hi> That is, that the perſons final act of <hi>Self-killing</hi> was not <hi>his</hi> or <hi>her Act;</hi> but the Effect of <hi>Melancholy</hi> to a <hi>great</hi> heighth (as a Natural Diſeaſe) work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him: or of <hi>Satan,</hi> by his <hi>violent Impreſſions and Importunities;</hi> but uſing his or her <hi>Natural Members</hi> or <hi>Powers,</hi> for the Production of <hi>ſo direful and ſad an Effect.</hi> It is true, the judgment is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard, becauſe in ſuch Caſes we cannot
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62919:45"/> determine; eſpecially in Fits, to what <hi>degree</hi> the perſon is deprived of the uſe of his or her Reaſon; and acteth but like a brute Creature. And this makes ſuch iſſues, whatever they prove to the perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned immediately; yet to their Friends very uncomfortable. So as although they do not mourn for them <hi>wholly without hope.</hi> Yet of all Mourners for Relations, they mourn with the <hi>leaſt</hi> hope, and are <hi>hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to be comforted.</hi> But this is all I ſhall ſpeak to this <hi>Doctrinally.</hi> What I princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally intended in this Diſcourſe, will fall into the Application.</p>

                  <p>What Care we had <hi>need</hi> to take, for the prevention and reſiſting of Temptations to Self-Murther. From what Efficient Cauſes ſuch Temptations may be our Luſts: The World, the Devil; theſe ſometimes acting jointly. What Luſts ordinarily incline us to it. How to know if the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation be from a ſingle or a mixt Cauſe, and from what Cauſe it is.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>YOu have heard from my former Diſcourſe, That <hi>Temptations</hi> are <hi>Motions to Sin,</hi> and that all ſuch Motions proceed either <hi>from our own Luſts,</hi> or <hi>from the World,</hi> or from our <hi>grand Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary the Devil;</hi> and that theſe three <hi>Principal Cauſes,</hi> ſometimes act <hi>ſingly,</hi> ſometimes <hi>jointly;</hi> and it is a matter of no ſmall moment, for a Chriſtian under the <hi>power of a Temptation,</hi> rightly to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, from what hand his <hi>Temptation comes;</hi> Whether it be meerly the <hi>Dictate</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:62919:48"/> 
                  <hi>of his own Luſt,</hi> or whether it comes from <hi>Men in the World,</hi> or <hi>whether it comes from the Devil?</hi> From <hi>one of theſe Caſes ſingly,</hi> or <hi>from two of them acting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther joyntly;</hi> and ſo the Temptation be a <hi>mixed Temptation.</hi> Nor do I think it will be very difficult to a diligent obſerving Chriſtian to make a true judgment in the Caſe. For the <hi>Men of the World,</hi> as Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations of this Nature are not very or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary from them, we ſhall (in theſe days of Light) ſeldom or never hear Reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Perſons, ſerious and in earneſt one with another, perſwading them to deſtroy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: So <hi>they can make no ſuch Motions to us, but will be obvious to our Senſe. Job</hi> heard his Wife, when ſhe ſaid unto him, <hi>Curſe God and die;</hi> Job. 2. 9. It is true, the Men of the World, may by <hi>vexing</hi> and <hi>tormenting us,</hi> be to us <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Cauſes</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Temptation;</hi> but that ſignifieth nothing, the principal Efficiency in thoſe <hi>Temptations,</hi> muſt be <hi>from our own Luſts.</hi> So that the onely difficulty of Judgment in theſe Cauſes, will be to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, <hi>Whether ſuch Motions</hi> or <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions flow meerly from our Luſts,</hi> or <hi>meerly from Satan,</hi> or partly from <hi>our Luſts,</hi> and partly <hi>from the Devil.</hi>

               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:62919:49"/>1. I am not difficult to believe <hi>that a Man or Woman may be Tempted to deſtroy him, or her ſelf, meerly from his or her own Luſt,</hi> drawn away and enticed. I believe <hi>Saul</hi> was ſo, and <hi>Ahithophel</hi> was ſo. <hi>Saul</hi> ſaw he was like to come into his Enemies hand, and his <hi>Luſt of Impatience</hi> prevailed upon him, to prevent it by a Self-Murther. <hi>Ahithophel</hi> had a Luſt of <hi>Ambition,</hi> and was not <hi>patient</hi> of the <hi>ſhame of being out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witted,</hi> and defeated as to his Honour and Reputation: And this I take to be the Caſe of <hi>Zimri; 1 Kings</hi> 16. 18. Now the <hi>Original Luſt</hi> which draws in theſe Caſes, is, <hi>An over eager deſire of a greater portion of thoſe which we count good things in this Life, then it will pleaſe God in the Wiſdom of his Providence to allot us:</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be <hi>Honour</hi> and Applauſe, <hi>Riches</hi> or a Plentiful Eſtate, <hi>Eaſe</hi> or <hi>Perſonal Freedem</hi> from <hi>Miſery</hi> and <hi>Torment, &amp;c.</hi> This prevailing in the Soul, when it ſeeth it is croſt in theſe deſires, or is like to be croſſed as to them; the Man or Woman, either <hi>through fear</hi> of what is like to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall him or her, or in an <hi>heighth of diſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> and <hi>impatience</hi> for what hath befallen them; deſtroyeth him or her ſelf. But now this cannot be in any Souls but ſuch as are poſſeſſed of <hi>Atheiſtical Principles,</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:62919:49"/> and rooted in a <hi>disbelief</hi> of the Scriptures and the <hi>whole Revealed Will of God</hi> (if at the time they be in the exerciſe of their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.) The Reaſon is this: Becauſe if they believe that there is a God, and that the holy Scriptures are the Word of God; which ſay, <hi>No Murtherer hath Eternal Life;</hi> they muſt believe, that by that Act of <hi>Self-Murther,</hi> they expoſe themſelves to Ten thouſand times greater Evils of <hi>Shame, Miſery,</hi> and <hi>Torment,</hi> and <hi>that for ever;</hi> than they can poſſibly avoid by it. So as from hence is evident, that no <hi>Child of God,</hi> no Believer, none that hath any thing of the Grace of God in him, being in the uſe of his Reaſon, can poſſibly be <hi>led away by his own Luſt and enticed</hi> to this Sin. Where this Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on prevaileth and is the meer effect of Luſt, it muſt be in an <hi>Atheiſtical Heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Soul,</hi> wholly under the Ignorance or Unbelief of the holy Scriptures, and what they Reveal concerning this Sin, and concerning <hi>Eternal Life:</hi> Such were the <hi>Heathens;</hi> ſuch was <hi>Ahithophel; Saul, Zimri, Judas,</hi> &amp;c. As to ſuch, the Luſts of our <hi>Iraſcible Appetite</hi> (as the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher ſpeaks) may be oft times Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But Secondly, Theſe Temptations
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:62919:50"/> or <hi>Motions to Sin,</hi> may, and doubtleſs <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often do proceed from Satan ſingly.</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth not ſo ordinarily ſay <hi>Kill thy ſelf, as ſpare thy ſelf,</hi> and truly when we conſider, how Nature abhorreth its own diſſolution, how naturally we flee from every evil and unpleaſant thing, we may reaſonably wonder, that ever any Man ſhould from his own Luſts be moved and ſolicited to deſtroy himſelf: and no queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but Nature muſt be in ſome diſorder, and there muſt be a great conqueſt over it before it can be. It muſt be a great Good ſhewed us that muſt ballance the <hi>Good of Life;</hi> and a great <hi>Evil,</hi> that muſt ballance the <hi>Evil of a Diſſolution.</hi> But certainly theſe Motions are very ordinary from the Devil, <hi>he was a Murtherer from the beginning; John.</hi> 8. 44. Now where this Temptation floweth <hi>ſingly from the Devil,</hi> it is eaſily diſcerned, whether he appeareth in any viſible Shape, and diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth an <hi>humane voice,</hi> or worketh by a more <hi>ſecret Impreſſion upon our Spirits;</hi> for if it floweth ſingly <hi>from him,</hi> the <hi>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> effect of it</hi> is <hi>Horror, Terror, and Trouble,</hi> to the Soul that is <hi>diſturbed</hi> with it. The Soul admits it into no Council, takes no Pleaſure in the Thoughts of it; deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berateth not upon it, ſuffereth it not to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62919:50"/> lodge within it for a Night: ſaith, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan;</hi> and though it may be the Impreſſion reneweth upon it again and again, yet ſtill it meeteth with no better Entertainment: if once the Soul hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberated upon it, had Thoughts to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to it, been pleaſed with it; it is no longer a Single Temptation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But indeed ordinarily Temptations of this Nature are <hi>mixed Temptations;</hi> with this difference,</p>
               <p>1. Sometimes <hi>Luſt moveth firſt,</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> falleth in with the Motions of that. Sometimes <hi>the Luſt of Diſcontent, ſometimes a Luſt of Impatience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Men or Women are proud, and of high Spirits, aiming at high things, To be before, and to excel others, to live at a geeat Rate, or in great degrees of Honour and Applauſe; it may be they have lived ſo formerly, it hath pleaſed the Providence of God to <hi>humble them</hi> and bring them low, and out of eſteem; to Spoil their Reputation, <hi>lay their He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in the Duſt,</hi> deveſt them of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates: they are not able to bear it, and entertain thoughts of putting an end to their Lives. You ſhall find Temptations of this Nature ſo far influencing the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, that although indeed they
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62919:51"/> have not adventured upon ſuch wickedneſs, yet <hi>they have prayed to God to take away their Lives.</hi> Thus <hi>Jonah,</hi> to avoid the oblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy of a falſe Prophet, <hi>Jonah. 4. 3. Therefore now, O Lord, take I beſeech thee, my Life from me; for it is better for me to die then to live.</hi> 2. Sometimes a <hi>Luſt</hi> of <hi>Impatience</hi> under <hi>preſent afflictions</hi> prevaileth upon them, hence under great degrees of <hi>pains and miſery,</hi> we ſhall find ſome preſſed with ſuch ſinful thoughts: and this again hath ſo far prevailed with Gods own Servants, that although we do not read that in the ſenſe of them they had thoughts to kill themſelves, yet we do find that they have <hi>prayed God to put an end to their Lives;</hi> you have two great inſtances in Scripture, that of <hi>Job,</hi> who Chap. 3. Curſed the day of his Birth, and <hi>Job 6. 8, 9. Oh that I might have my Requeſt! and that God would grant me the thing that I long for! even that it would pleaſe God to deſtroy me, that he would let looſe his Hand and cut me off.</hi> So <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>3. Sometimes the Luſt of <hi>Servile ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh fear,</hi> when men and women have a <hi>Proſpect of ſome great Evils that are like to come upon them,</hi> and are not able to bear the thoughts of them, nor to live in the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62919:51"/> view of them. In this caſe we ſhall find Temptations alſo have prevailed upon Gods own People to <hi>deſire Death,</hi> though not to be the inſtruments of their own Death. This was the Caſe of <hi>Elijah, 1 Kings 19. 4. Jezebel</hi> ſending a meſſage to him, had ſworn by her Gods that by the next day ſhe would kill <hi>Elijah,</hi> as he had done by Baals Prieſts. v. 3. v. 4. he goes into the Wilderneſs, <hi>he goeth into the Wilderneſs</hi> and <hi>ſits under a Juniper Tree, and requeſteth for himſelf that he might die;</hi> and ſaith, <hi>It is enough now, O Lord, take away my life; for I am not better than my Fathers.</hi> Now where any of theſe Luſts predominate at any time, the Devil doth very ordinarily join his ſtrength with it, and makes frequent and violent impreſſions upon the Spirits of Chriſtians; putting them upon the <hi>mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of themſelves;</hi> and where he meets with men or women that are ignorant or of baſe <hi>Atheiſtical hearts,</hi> who do not believe <hi>there is a God,</hi> or that there is ſuch a thing as <hi>Eternity,</hi> either an <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> or <hi>Hell,</hi> a place of Eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or Eternal torment or miſery, or an Immortal State of a Soul; it is not at all to be wondered that he doth very often prevail. For if they can but look
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62919:52"/> upon <hi>death</hi> coming upon them any way as a freedom from miſery and the grave, as a place where <hi>the wicked ceaſe from troubling,</hi> where <hi>the weary be at reſt,</hi> where <hi>the priſoners reſt together,</hi> and <hi>hear not the voice of the oppreſſor;</hi> it is but natural to them to cry out, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is Light given unto him that is in Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Life to the bitter in Soul, which long for death but it cometh not; and dig for it as for hid Treaſures; and rejoyce exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, and are glad when they can find the Grave.</hi> But now it being impoſſible that a Believer that knoweth the Scriptures and believeth them, and agreeth to the Immortality of the Soul and the torments of Hell, the truth of the <hi>Worm never dying,</hi> and the <hi>Fire</hi> that <hi>never goeth out,</hi> and that <hi>all Murderers ſhall have their portion in the Lake where this Worm</hi> this <hi>Fire is;</hi> ſhould ever look upon Death and the Grave in this dull notion. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan can never prevail with him. So that no ſuch Soul, while he is poſſeſſed of any Liberty to uſe his Reaſon, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from Principles, can poſſibly be prevailed upon.</p>
               <p>2. Sometimes it may be, <hi>The Motion may be firſt from the Devil,</hi> who ſeeing a Man or Woman, in great pain or

                  <p>By what Seeming Good the Soul tempted to Self-Murther, may be drawn away and inticed. What good greater than Life. Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life a greater good. This
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62919:53"/> can bait no Believer to ſuch an <hi>Act</hi> why. Immunity from ſome great Evil felt, or imminent, the onely appearing Good in the Caſe. A Caſe ariſing from a Souls being poſſeſt of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Election. <hi>Whether that can give this Temptation ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage? It is denied.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUt it may poſſibly be worthy of our Inquiry, What can be a Bait fitting for ſuch a Trap? He who is <hi>tempted</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>is drawn away by his own luſt and enticed:</hi> No Man is enticed, but by ſome <hi>appearing Good.</hi> None can be <hi>drawn away</hi> from <hi>a Good,</hi> nor <hi>enticed out of the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of it,</hi> but upon the <hi>view of a greater Good,</hi> poſſible or probable to be obtained by parting with that which is leſſer. Now Life being in the <hi>Eye of Nature</hi> the greateſt Good, <hi>Skin for Skin</hi> (ſaith the Devil) <hi>and all a man hath, for his Life.</hi> One would think the <hi>Devil</hi> could not ſhew a Man or Woman any thing, for the <hi>obtaining</hi> of which he ſhould <hi>delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately</hi> and <hi>voluntarily</hi> part with his Life.</p>
               <p>To this I Anſwer two things,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:62919:53"/>1, Though <hi>Natural Life,</hi> in <hi>Pleaſing Circumſtances,</hi> be the greateſt <hi>Natural Good;</hi> yet <hi>Life Eternal</hi> is a more <hi>Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Good.</hi> So that if it be poſſible that a man ſhould be cheated by his own heart, or by the Devil, ſo as to believe that the diſpoſſeſſion of himſelf of his <hi>Natural Life,</hi> ſhall bring him into the poſſeſſion of an <hi>Eternal Life;</hi> he may upon that account be rationally perſwaded to determine his own Life. Thus the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil impoſed upon ſome of the Heathens; who had by the Light of Nature but a dim Proſpect of that <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> which the Apoſtle telleth us is <hi>brought to Light by the Goſpel:</hi> Dreaming that an happy State of the Soul in another Life, was the common portion of all men, or at leaſt of all that lived up in any degree to the Rules of <hi>Moral Vertue;</hi> and not underſtanding, that the <hi>Wages of Sin was Death,</hi> nor the right way to <hi>Eternal Life;</hi> nor that of the Apoſtle, <hi>That no Murtherer hath Eternal Life abiding for him,</hi> no more than abiding in him; they might eaſily be ſo cheated: as <hi>Cleom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brotus</hi> and others. But it is not poſſible that a Believer (one I mean, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth the Scriptures) ſhould be thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed: for by Faith he knows, That the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62919:54"/> Law is, <hi>Thou ſhalt do no Murther, That no Murtherer hath Eternal Life. That the Murtherer</hi> is one of thoſe Sinners that <hi>have their portion in the Second Death:</hi> Rev. 21. 8. and therefore not in the Second Life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, Though <hi>Natural Life, in pleaſing Circumſtances, may be the greateſt Natural Good;</hi> yet this <hi>Natural Life, as to particular perſons, may be ſo ill circumſtanced, that a preſent freedom from ſome Evil, may to a Natural Eye appear a much greater Good; in compariſon of which even Life it ſelf may be an Evil undeſirable</hi> and abhorred. Life is much rated by the happy or leſs happy Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of it. Even Nature it ſelf would not deſire a Life of Continual and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream pain. And indeed, This <hi>Eaſe</hi> and <hi>Immunity from Evils,</hi> which either at preſent oppreſs us, or hang over our heads, ſo that we have, or think we have them in a certain Proſpect, not probable to be avoided, is the onely <hi>appearing good</hi> that can <hi>entice us</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine our own Lives. For Death de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving us of all Poſitive Senſible Good Things, ſuch as Riches, Pleaſures, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, Honours, Relations, all kind of Senſual Satisfactions. And this <hi>Death</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62919:54"/> no way or means, and ſuch a thing as cannot poſſibly appear to any but Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens and Infidels, as any means to bring us to any <hi>Eternal Good;</hi> there remaineth nothing of any umbrage or Colour of Good in it, by which it is poſſible we ſhould be cheated, but onely a <hi>Superſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas</hi> from, or <hi>Determination of thoſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, which we either think we have in a near and certain Proſpect hardly avoidable, or under the preſſure of which we groan, being burthened, and ſeek a Releaſe from.</hi> And if (as I ſhall have occaſion enough hereafter to ſhew you) Death thus brought upon our ſelves by our own hands, will not be a productive of this Effect, but ſo far as we can poſſibly judge, bring us into a far deeper Gulf of Miſery than what we are already in; and make our Caſe a thouſand times more ſad than it is already: We muſt conclude it is onely an <hi>Appearence of Good</hi> by which we are cheated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But I hear ſome ſay, upon the Hypotheſis of ſome, <hi>That there is an Election of Grace, and that thoſe who are choſen unto Eternal Life, cannot periſh; why may not Men and Women deſtroy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they may be in Heaven: for if they be Elected, they ſhall he Saved.</hi>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:62919:55"/> 
                  <hi>And if they be not Elected, let them live as long as they can,</hi> they ſhall be damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> This may be ignorantly ſpoken, by ſuch as know not the Scriptures, nor what they, who aſſert from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the <hi>Doctrine of Election,</hi> do main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: but it cannot be ſaid by any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding perſons, who knoweth any thing of the Mind and Will of God in the Scriptures, or what they reveal as to the <hi>Doctrine of Election.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. For I beſeech you to conſider, 1. <hi>That nothing can be a Temptation to any, to deprive himſelf of the greateſt natural good, but an apprehenſion of a certain enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of a greater good;</hi> though it be granted that Eternal Life be certainly a greater good than a Natural Life, yet if I do not apprehend, that by departing out of this preſent Life, I ſhall certainly be put into the poſſeſſion of that better Life; and by no other way ſo adequate I ſhall never be perſwaded upon that Speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to part with this Life; for <hi>good as good doth not move our appetite,</hi> but as ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly that it is impoſſible, <hi>that any one ſhould apprehend, that by depriving himſelf of his Natural Life, he ſhould be
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:62919:55"/> poſſeſſed of an Eternal Life;</hi> for I pray obſerve me; ſuch an apprehenſion muſt be <hi>bottomed</hi> upon one of theſe things, 1. Either that <hi>Eternal Life ſhall be the common Portion of all Men</hi> after this Life, which indeed might be the apprehenſion of ſome Heathens, but cannot poſſibly be fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied by any Intelligent Chriſtian; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, the <hi>Notices</hi> we have of a State of <hi>Eternal Happineſs</hi> are very Imperfect, beſides ſuch as we have from the Goſpel, which the Apoſtle ſaith have brought <hi>Life and Immortality to Light.</hi> I ſay beſides this, the Scriptures plainly reveals, that there is an <hi>Hell</hi> as well as an <hi>Heaven,</hi> a State of <hi>Miſery</hi> as well as <hi>Happineſs;</hi> that ſome ſhall riſe to <hi>Shame and Contempt,</hi> as others to Life and Glory. 2. Or elſe Secondly, It muſt be founded upon this. <hi>That they know that they are elected unto Life:</hi> For I appeal to the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Suppoſe that I know and am aſſured, <hi>that God hath choſen ſome from before the Foundation of the World, to whom he will give Eternal Life;</hi> and admit again <hi>that I am equally aſſured that no perſon ſo choſen of God unto Eternal Life, can Eternally Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh;</hi> yet what pretence is here for me, unleſs I have <hi>alſo an aſſurance</hi> or <hi>perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that I am one of thoſe whom God hath</hi>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:62919:56"/> 
                  <hi>from Eternity ſo choſen, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not periſh; to throw away the greateſt tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good I have (viz.</hi> my Life) <hi>to obtain that greater ſupernatural good of Life Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; whileſt I am in the certain poſſeſſion of the former, and have no aſſurance of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> Now it is impoſſible, that any one, that hath deliberations in his heart to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſo great an Evil, and ſo ripened as to reſolve to do it; ſhould have any <hi>Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> or any certain apprehenſions, that he is one of the <hi>Elect of God,</hi> or <hi>that he was ever born of God:</hi> The Reaſon is this, becauſe <hi>all ſuch Aſſurance muſt be from the Word of God, and the Spirit of God; ſetting home the Word of God upon the Soul, and conforming the Soul to the Image of God.</hi> Now the Word of God ſaith, <hi>No Murtherer hath Eternal Life,</hi> it ſaith <hi>Murtherers ſhall have their Portion in the Lake which burneth with Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone; which is the ſecond Death.</hi> So far is it from ſaying that any perſons, that deliberate, and do ſuch things, are <hi>the Elect of God,</hi> and ſhall certainly have E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Life: So as the Notion of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection</hi> and its <hi>certainty,</hi> and of <hi>Effectual Grace,</hi> and its abiding in the Soul, cannot poſſibly give any reaſonable advantage to this Temptation; propoſing to the Soul
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62919:56"/> that deliberateth, and is about to do any ſuch thing, any ſuch <hi>Supereminent Good</hi> as Eternal Life, to be obtained, by <hi>parting with this Life,</hi> without any direction from God, who is the Lord of it: Nay it rather giveth the greateſt diſcouragement imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by threatning Eternal Death to thoſe who do ſuch things; and barring the Gates of Heaven againſt them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nay, Thirdly, admitting that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to be true. <hi>That if a Man be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, he ſhall certainly be Saved;</hi> let him die when, and how he will: and <hi>if he be not elected, he ſhall certainly Periſh:</hi> Yet neither can this give the leaſt incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to ſo vile an Act, for ſo long as his heart is full of ſo great a Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>he can have no grounded Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that he is elected;</hi> and ſo cannot be allured to the Action, by the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of enjoying Eternal Life; which is a far greater good than the life he parteth with. So neither can any be certain that <hi>he is not choſen unto Life,</hi> and if he could be certain of that, yet no mans reaſon can dictate to him, that infinite <hi>Torments and Miſery</hi> are a <hi>leſſer Evil</hi> than <hi>any of the Evils of this Life;</hi> which in obedience to this Temptation, he would flee from, by putting a period to his days: Or that
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62919:57"/> it is eligible for him to throw himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe Torments before the time. So that it is impoſſible, That the Notions of <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Pretenſion,</hi> or the <hi>certain Determination of Man, as to his Eternal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,</hi> ſhould give the leaſt aid, and aſſiſtance unto this Temptation. But the onely <hi>appearing good</hi> that can entice any to hearken to a Temptation of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, muſt be <hi>a freedom</hi> from <hi>ſome preſent Evil,</hi> or ſome <hi>imminent Evil.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>I come now to what in this Diſcourſe I did chiefly intend: <hi>viz.</hi> To ſhew what is to be done in the Caſe of this Temptation; either for the <hi>Preventing</hi> theſe Impreſſions: Or, Secondly, for the Reſiſting of them, if we find they be come to Temptations. I will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe a little largely upon the Firſt Head, for as we ſay, <hi>Preventing Phyſick is the Beſt Phyſick.</hi> It doth at leaſt ſave the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient a great deal of <hi>Pain</hi> and <hi>Trouble.</hi> And what we ſay in another Caſe, <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius ejicitur quam non admittitur hoſpes.</hi> It is not ſo eaſie to caſt an Enemy out, who hath once got poſſeſſion, as to keep him out at firſt from ſuch poſſeſſion; it is true here. And here alſo I ſhall ſpeak to all. It is poſſible but one of many that is fallen under the burden of this <hi>Temptation;</hi> but there is none of us all, but for ought we know, may come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Burthen, which others have found
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:62919:58"/> too heavy for them to bear. The Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therefore is,</p>
               <p>Qu. <hi>What a Chriſtian ſhould do, that he may never be under this great affliction; that he may never be tempted to this great Evil of Deſtroying himſelf by his own Hands?</hi> A thing which it may be you ſtartle at and are now ready to ſay, as <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zael</hi> in another Caſe, <hi>Am I a dead Dog, that I ſhould do ſuch things.</hi> Yet it may ſo fall out, that as <hi>Hazael</hi> did, what he profeſſed ſo great an abhorrence of; ſo you may do, or entertain thoughts to do, what now your thoughts ſeem to you at furtheſt diſtance; even as to this <hi>horrid Temptation. He that yet ſtandeth, had need take heed leſt he falleth.</hi> Nor will I promiſe you to give you ſo perfect Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, as the Practice of them ſhall give you an infallible Security. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to tell you how far the Wiſdom of God, may, or may not, think fit to try any of you; and in order to it, to let looſe Satan againſt you: Nor how far Luſt and Corruption may prevail in any of you. I ſhall onely adviſe the moſt probable means.</p>
               <p>1. In the firſt place, <hi>Take heed as to your Bodily Health, with reſpect to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy:</hi> Experience telleth us, That
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62919:58"/> few Religious Souls are infeſted with theſe Impreſſions, but ſuch as are cloiſtered in <hi>Melancholick Bodies.</hi> Melancholy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing, darkens our Reaſon, that we are not able to make true Concluſions from Goſpel Principles; and the ſame Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence alſo tells us, That there are few, even Religious Perſons, that fall into great Prevailings of <hi>Melancholy,</hi> if it abideth long upon them, but they have ſome or more Impreſſions of this Nature, although indeed, in ſome they be weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in others they be ſtronger. Some have them more often repeated, others more ſeldom. This therefore is highly to be attended by every good Chriſtian, who dreadeth the thoughts of ſo dark an hour of Temptation as this is. For although (as I told you in the former part of my Diſcourſe) I do believe every Child of God hath the Seed of God ſo far abide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him, as he ſhall never murther himſelf; yet the prevailings of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper may ſo far diſtract him (for ought I know) that he may <hi>kill himſelf,</hi> as well as one in another Diſtraction, by a Feavour, or the like, which taketh away the uſe of his Reaſon. And this is very ſad and uncomfortable. Beſides, if it ſhould not riſe ſo high, yet the beſt of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:62919:59"/> Chriſtians may have a long trouble and diſquietude given him from ſuch motions and ſolicitations, though finally they do not ſo far prevail againſt him. If you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore love your Souls, the <hi>peace, quiet;</hi> and <hi>comfort</hi> of them; if you would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the trouble and diſturbance of theſe Temptations and Impreſſions, Take heed of the prevailings of this Humour. You will ſay to me, What can we do in this Caſe? I anſwer, There are <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Moral,</hi> or <hi>Civil,</hi> and <hi>Religious Means</hi> to be uſed, do not neglect them.</p>
               <p>1. The <hi>Natural Means</hi> are <hi>ſuch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines or Preſcriptions as Learned Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> (who are doubtleſs Gods Ordinance in this Caſe) <hi>ſhall judge</hi> fit <hi>to direct</hi> and <hi>preſcribe.</hi> I have not without a great deal of trouble ſometimes obſerved the ſtubbornneſs of ſome (in other things) intelligent Chriſtians, as to this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. O (they will tell you) Phyſicians can do them no good; God muſt cure, God muſt heal them: and who denieth but that, <hi>It is God muſt heal them?</hi> But it is every whit as rational, to ſay you will <hi>eat no Meat,</hi> or <hi>drink no Drink;</hi> it is God that muſt maintain your Souls in life; as to ſay, when you are under greater and more dangerous Bodily Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62919:59"/> you will take no Phyſick, uſe no Means, becauſe it is <hi>God muſt heal you.</hi> Becauſe God muſt heal us, muſt he therefore work a Miracle in doing it for us? Or doth not God do it ordinarily by his Concurrence with Natural Means, in which he hath created a Natural Vertue, in order to that End. It is true ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Phyſicians prove of no value in the Caſe; but it is as true that very often God doth concur with, and bleſs Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Means; and I have often known, that the uſe of Natural Means, in the beginning eſpecially of theſe Diſtempers, where alſo this <hi>Temptation</hi> hath commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with this Bodily Diſtemper, hath both removed the Diſtemper and the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo. God will not pleaſe always to work certainly and infallibly with Means, that we may know that our Healings are from him.</p>
               <p>There are beſides theſe, Moral and Rational Means to be uſed; which though they do not as the other, purge out the <hi>peccant humour,</hi> yet hinder the Increaſe and Effects of it. Let me name ſome of them:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Take heed about imploying your Senſes about terrible Objects;</hi> either ſeeing Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that are apt to affright and terrifie,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:62919:60"/> or hearing Relations or Diſcourſes of that Nature, or Reading Books upon Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects apt to affright and terrifie. When Men and Women are under this Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Objects very ordinarily make very deep Impreſſions upon our Fancy; and as we ought at all times to avoid Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that may feed our thoughts inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the obedience of other Luſts, ſo under this Diſtemper we are equally concerned to divert our Senſes from any Objects which may feed our Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with what may cauſe <hi>exceſſive and immoderate fears and terrors in us.</hi> Upon the ſame reaſon, that perſons who find in their hearts diſpoſitions to Levity and Wantonneſs, and the Luſts of the Fleſh, ought with <hi>Job</hi> to make <hi>a Covenant with their Eyes, that they will not look upon Objects,</hi> that may miniſter Fuel to their Luſts: Yea, and with their Ears too, that they will not hear any Diſcourſes of that Tendency: The Melancholick Perſon, being natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally inclined to an exceſs of <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Sorrow,</hi> ought to make a Covenant with his or her <hi>Exteriour Senſes,</hi> that they will not fetch in, or receive any Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that have an aptitude, or fitneſs in them, to increaſe <hi>Fears</hi> and Exceſſive <hi>Sorrow</hi> and <hi>Sadneſs, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:62919:60"/>2. <hi>Take heed of Solitude,</hi> and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much to be alone. It is uſually ſaid that <hi>every one who is alone (much alone) proves either a God</hi> or a <hi>Devil to himſelf.</hi> There is nothing of more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to a Man or Woman, if they be in health and under no diſturbances of Mind and Spirit, than to be alone: It was wont to be ſaid by a great <hi>Roman, That he was never leſs alone, then when he was alone.</hi> A Good Chriſtian in clear Circumſtances, is never more with God then when he is alone, nor doth ordinarily ever enjoy more of God. But the caſe is quite contrary if one be under the prevailings of this Diſtemper, He is never more expoſed to <hi>Temptations,</hi> he is never mote baited by the Devil then when he is alone: Solitude is by no means adviſable in an hour of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: I obſerve, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 1. That when Chriſt was to be tempted by the Devil, he was <hi>by the Spirit carried into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Divert thy ſelf by Imployment what thou canſt.</hi> The great Evils which hazard the Soul under this Diſtemper, ariſe <hi>from the too much fixation of the thoughts upon ſome particular terrible Objects.</hi> Hence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is proper to divert the thoughts,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:62919:61"/> that they pore not too much upon ſuch terrible things which are moſt obvious to them, is a very rational mean to be uſed in order, if not to the rooting out of the Cauſe, yet to the preventing the ſad Effects of this Diſtemper. Hence you ſhall obſerve in that Story of <hi>Elijah,</hi> 1 Kings. 19.

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62919:61"/> and for them, by all means to avoid <hi>Solitude</hi> and to drive them out from their pleaſing Solititudes; and to imploy them and divert them: God ſends <hi>Elijah</hi> a Journey, v. 15. to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> to anoint <hi>Hazael King of Syria;</hi> and to anoint <hi>Jehu King of Iſrael:</hi> Other directions of this Nature I leave to Phyſicians.</p>
               <p>3.

There ſeems to be much hidden even from the Wiſeſt Naturaliſts; and to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſomething Divine; beyond what the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteſt Wits and Reaſons have diſcovered. I would therefore have ſuch perſons by no means omit <hi>Reading and Hearing the Word of God. Sorrow maketh an heart to ſtoop,</hi> (ſaith Solomon) <hi>but a good word makes it better.</hi> I have heard a Story of a Good Woman under a great Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:62919:62"/> to deſtroy her ſelf, and going about to drown her ſelf, firſt taking her Bible, and caſually opening it, and caſting her Eye on a Text declaring the great Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God to Sinners, ſhe preſently ſaith, to her ſelf, <hi>Nay, if it be ſo, I will not drown my ſelf yet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if there were nothing (as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is very much) by perſons to be expected upon the Promiſe of God, to perſons performing their Duty, in Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Waiting upon God in his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; yet I know no Reaſon but the thoughts of perſons may be diverted by what they Read and Hear in Sacred and Holy things, as well as other things which have not ſuch a Stamp and Impreſs of God upon them. <hi>Prayer</hi> is the general way of <hi>Application</hi> and <hi>Addreſs</hi> unto God in all Caſes, if we know no <hi>due Means,</hi> Prayer obtains Wiſdom and Direction from God; if we uſe <hi>due Means,</hi> Prayer obtaineth a Bleſſing from God upon the uſe of them: If ſomething muſt be done for us beyond the <hi>Natural Force</hi> and <hi>Vertue of Means, Prayer</hi> obtaineth that from God. But I ſhall add no more to this firſt Direction, upon which I had not inlarged ſo far, but that I find it ſo hard to perſwade perſons under this <hi>Temptation</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:62919:62"/> that it is advantaged by this <hi>Natural Diſtemper;</hi> than which there is nothing more evident upon all Experience, that both this and another Sore Temptation, as to which I ſhall ſpeak ſomething in my following Diſcourſe, are all highly advantaged and promoved by it; and therefore a taking heed to our ſelves in this Caſe, is alſo very neceſſary to prevent them: and I intend when I ſpeak to them, to add little more upon this Argument, but onely refer to what I have ſaid in this Chapter; which hath made me willing once for all to diſcourſe it more largely. Now I proceed.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>A Second Direction to prevent Temptations of this Nature. The Mortification of Pride. The Influence which Pride hath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Soul, in order to the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing or promoving ſuch thoughts in us; as it is the great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Diſcontent, upon Gods altering our External Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. Conſiderations to be digeſted, in order to the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62919:63"/> of our Souls in a mean o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of our Selves.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>2. IN the Second place, <hi>Take heed of Pride,</hi> live in the Mortification of that Luſt. <hi>Solomon</hi> hath three Wiſe Sentences in his Book of <hi>Proverbs,</hi> which we ſhould have at all times ingraven in our hearts. <hi>Prov. 11. 2. When Pride cometh, then cometh Shame.</hi> Prov. 16. 18. <hi>Pride goeth before deſtruction: and an haughty ſpirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a fall.</hi> The laſt is, Prov. 29. 23. <hi>A mans pride ſhall bring him low:</hi> I do not think that there are three other pieces of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Will of God, that are more verified in daily experience than theſe are. I do not know any Soul that is more expoſed to Temptations to Sin, nor oftner falleth into them, nor that is more expoſed to Temptations for Sin, than the <hi>Proud Soul.</hi> Pride is a corruption that ſwelleth a man in the opinion of a mans own merit, worth, and excellency, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently breedeth in him an impatience of any thing that ſhould leſſen his eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in the ſight of others. <hi>Ahithophel</hi> was a proud Man, and not able to bear his diſgrace at Court, but chuſeth rather to hang himſelf. Whenſoever any <hi>preſent ſhame,</hi> or fear of future ſhame,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62919:63"/> any degradation, or loſs of <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute in the World,</hi> gives a riſe to ſuch motions as theſe in our hearts, to deſtroy our ſelves; or gives the Devil any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to enforce ſuch impreſſions upon us, <hi>Pride</hi> is the bottom of it. It is therefore highly adviſable for Chriſtians, <hi>To be cloathed with Humility,</hi> to put on <hi>Humbleneſs of Mind,</hi> as the Apoſtle exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. An humble Soul is hardly taken in this Snare of the Devil. Two or three things will much contribute to this hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of Mind. 1: <hi>The conſideration of what we are, what we brought with us into the World, and from whom we had it. 2. The Conſideration of what we deſerve.</hi> 3. The Conſideration, how <hi>little a thing it is to be great in the World.</hi> I ſay, 1. The Conſideration of <hi>what we are, what we brought with us into the world; and from whom we had our all that we have.</hi> Lord what is Man, that he ſhould be lifted up? He is made up of two eſſential parts, <hi>The Soul and the Body.</hi> Our Philoſophy teacheth us, <hi>That all reaſonable Souls are equal,</hi> nor indeed is there any pretence in reaſon for any inequality originally in them. And are not our Bodies ſo alſo; are they not all Duſt, and ſuch as muſt return to Duſt?
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62919:64"/> Are they not all made of Clay? Have ſome Bodies a <hi>more beautiful colour,</hi> more <hi>ſymmetrical</hi> and <hi>proportionable parts</hi> than others? Do ſome Souls diſcover more excellent Parts and Endowments, through the better Conſtitution and Complexion of Bodies? Have ſome of us more Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and Reputation in the World, more Riches, and a greater portion of this Worlds Goods than others? Is any thing of this from our ſelves? Have we then built our own Bodies? Have we given them their Beauty or Symmetry? Have we ſo much as made one Hair of our Heads White or Black? Or added ſo much as one Cubit to our Stature in the World, in reſpect of Honour, Riches, and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation? Did we bring any of theſe things into the World with us? Can we carry them out of the World with us? <hi>If we have received them,</hi> why do we glory, <hi>why are we proud of them, as if we had not received them?</hi> Let others honour and admire us for them, we have no reaſon to admire our ſelves, nor to think highly of our ſelves; let us look to the <hi>Rock from which we were hewen, and to the hole of the Pit out of which we were digged.</hi> 2. But then (Secondly) let us conſider <hi>what we have deſerved.</hi> The
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62919:64"/> things upon which we value our ſelves, as thinking they make us to ſtand upon the higher ground, were neither <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary to us,</hi> nor have they been <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by us,</hi> by any Merit, of him who hath been our Benefactor as to them. The Apoſtle putteth them together, <hi>Proud, knowing nothing; 1 Tim.</hi> 6. 4. and truly ſo it is, the Man or Woman that is <hi>proud,</hi> is one that <hi>knoweth nothing.</hi> Knoweth nothing? How can that be, when ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily a Mans <hi>Knowledge</hi> is that which <hi>puffeth him up</hi> (it being indeed of any common and indiſtinguiſhing mercy, the nobleſt thing wherein a Man or Woman can differ from another) the Apoſtle in another place expoundeth this, when he telleth us, <hi>That he who thinketh that he knoweth any thing, knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know it;</hi> 1 Cor. 8. 2. But this is certainly true, that the <hi>Proud Man or Woman knoweth nothing in things that are Spiritual.</hi> Or if he or ſhe have ſome <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Spiritual Things,</hi> they know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of them, <hi>as they ought to know them;</hi> they have not digeſted that knowledge by any <hi>ſerious Meditations,</hi> they do not believe it. Is it poſſible that any one ſhould be lifted up in an Opinion of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf above others, who looks to the Rock
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62919:65"/> from which he is hewed, and to the hole of the pit out of which he is digged, that he is the ſame <hi>Clay,</hi> the ſame <hi>Duſt</hi> with another; though it hath pleaſed the Potter to order him to be a Veſſel of more External Honour, and his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour a Veſſel of more Diſhonour in the World: Or that any one ſhould exalt himſelf above what is the Will of God concerning him, thinking that God doth not deal by him as he hath deſerved; who knoweth, <hi>That he was a Child of wrath by Nature:</hi> That he hath made himſelf much more ſo, by his actual Diſobediences: That he is puniſhed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times leſs than he hath deſerved. 3. Then conſider, <hi>How little a thing it is to be great in the World.</hi> It ſignifieth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as to our better part, but miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief for the moſt part. The Soul of Man is not bettered by <hi>Riches</hi> or <hi>Honour,</hi> or any of thoſe good things which affect us, as to our outward Man. It ſignifieth nothing, as to the <hi>Eternal State,</hi> either of Soul or Body, and as to the outward Man in this Life, which alone hath any concern in theſe things. They are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, we are ſet in ſuch ſlippery places, while we ſtand upon theſe Mountains of Ice and Glaſs, that no conſiderate Soul
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62919:65"/> can juſtly value himſelf upon them; but pray, O pray for an <hi>humble low Spirit.</hi> There is indeed a <hi>natural lowneſs and demiſſion of Mind,</hi> and that is a great happineſs, where God doth give it unto any. A naturally high and haughty Spirit is expoſed to greater Temptations than another that is naturally of a <hi>low</hi> and <hi>mean Spirit;</hi> as the tall <hi>Cedar</hi> and <hi>Oak</hi> is more expoſed to boiſterous Winds than the poor Shrub. There is alſo a <hi>Moral Humility,</hi> a lowneſs of Mind and Spirit cauſed from <hi>Education,</hi> and the <hi>due Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion</hi> of Moral Principles, and this alſo doth ſomething. But there is alſo an <hi>Habit of Humility,</hi> into which the Soul is wrought by the Holy Spirit of God; mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word of God to take hold of the Heart: when the <hi>Will of God</hi> is that which maketh the Heart to ſtoop, and brings it to a ſubmiſſion to its portion. This is of all other the more excellent, the moſt <hi>Divine,</hi> the moſt <hi>Effectual.</hi> Now there is nothing more effectual to arm a Soul againſt this Temptation than this <hi>lowlineſs of Mind;</hi> nothing more expoſing the Soul to this Temptation than that <hi>habit</hi> which is contrary to it. <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>height of Spirit,</hi> is the great Mother of <hi>Diſcontent,</hi> when it ceaſeth to be with us, as it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62919:66"/> was. Hence it is that Men and Women conclude, they had better not be, than be <hi>poor</hi> and in <hi>miſery;</hi> it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for them to put an end to their own days, than to be expoſed to <hi>ſhame, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,</hi> and <hi>obloquy.</hi> It is therefore of very high concernment to all of us that would be out of the danger of theſe Fiery Darts, to <hi>ſtudy humility,</hi> while we are in health, while we are in the higheſt circumſtances of proſperity, to be thinking of a lower ſtate and condition, and meditating of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the high things of the World, the incertainty and ſlipperineſs of them, the littleneſs of them under their greateſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances; to be thinking what poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures we are, how little we brought into this world with us, how little any of us have deſerved at the hands of God, to feed our ſelves continually with Meditation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <argument>
                  <p>A Third Direction for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting of this Temptation. The poſſeſſing of our Souls with Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence under, and arming of our Souls againſt, all manner of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content. The Miſchief of Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, the Excellency of Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the uſefulneſs of it.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>3. IF we would keep our ſelves from the Aſſaults of this Temptation, we muſt make it our buſineſs to learn <hi>in all eſtates to be content: To poſſeſs our ſelves with Patience, and arm our ſelves againſt all manner of Diſcontent.</hi> No Soul ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and contented with his or her ſtate, and condition; falleth into this <hi>Snare of the Devil;</hi> it is always the effect of <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content:</hi> Now Diſcontent is ordinarily bottomed in <hi>Pride,</hi> but poſſibly not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways. St. <hi>Paul</hi> telleth us, <hi>Phil. 4. 11. I have learned in whatſoever ſtate I am, therewith to be content. I know both how to</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:62919:67"/> 
                  <hi>be abaſed,</hi> and I know how to <hi>abound: every where, and in all things I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, both to be full, and to be hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, both how to abound, and ſuffer need.</hi> There is no ſuch <hi>Antidote</hi> as this againſt the Poiſon of this Fiery Dart: The Temptation lyeth here, <hi>Better be out of the World any way, then endure this Miſery, then be expoſed to this Shame, then come into the hands of ſuch Enemies.</hi> But the Soul that hath poſſeſſed it <hi>ſelf with Patience,</hi> that hath learned in <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Eſtate to be Content,</hi> and hath brought it ſelf into a willingneſs that God ſhould chuſe its Lot, and carve its Portion, for it is Armed as with a Coat of Male; no Dart of this Nature can poſſibly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate ſuch a a Soul. And ſuffer me to tell you, this will be a Leſſon hardly learned, if once the Evil be come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you; when the Senſe of the preſent E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil naturally ſtirreth up <hi>Paſſion</hi> in us: of ſo unſpeakable a Conſequence is it to have our Wills <hi>ſubdued to the Will of God,</hi> to that degree that it ſhall perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rule over us. In matters of Action we ſometimes may be at loſs, doubting <hi>what the will of God is,</hi> and what we ought to do; but now in any Caſe of <hi>Suffering,</hi> the <hi>Will of God</hi> is clear, there
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:62919:67"/> can be no diſpute about it: There can be no <hi>Evil of Puniſhment in a City,</hi> or in a Family, but <hi>God muſt be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> of it; it muſt be the <hi>Will of God</hi> that ſuch or ſuch a Perſon ſhould <hi>come to Poverty,</hi> come into <hi>Diſgrace,</hi> be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to <hi>Shame and Contempt;</hi> that this. or that Man or Woman ſhould be Rack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Tormented with ſuch a <hi>Diſeaſe.</hi> Now our Buſineſs muſt be, to bring our Wills to the Will of God; nor muſt this be ſtudied with reference to a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Caſe, for who can tell what ſhall befall him; but to learn with Saint <hi>Paul, in all things to be content,</hi> to have an Heart ready in all Eſſaies, in all Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences of this Life, to comply with the Divine Will: Not that it is poſſible, for a Chriſtian ſo far to ſubdue himſelf, that it ſhall not at all <hi>reluct,</hi> nor wiſh it it ſelf to be in a better Condition; but ſo far, that the <hi>Spirit ſhall get the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and Conquer the Motions of the Fleſh, and the Heart ſhall prefer the Will of God to its own Will; and this is a great buſineſs, to bring the Soul of a Man to this paſs. And in order to this, there is nothing ſo much to be ſtudied as <hi>Humility</hi> and the <hi>Mortification of Pride:</hi> For as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Onely by</hi>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:62919:68"/> 
                  <hi>Pride comes Contention.</hi> So give me leave to tell you, Onely from Pride cometh a Diſcontent at the Condition wherein God hath ſet us. For why is the Man or Woman diſcontented? But becauſe he or ſhe thinketh he or ſhe is <hi>unworthily dealt with, and hath not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what they have merited.</hi> It would be a far too great undertaking for me in a branch of Application, to direct means in order to this <hi>Contentment,</hi> and propound Rational, or Spiritual Conſiderations, which duly digeſted, with the Bleſſing of God upon them, may work the heart into this frame; there have been whole Volumns that have been written upon it by Divines of all ſorts. I ſhould onely commend one to you, written in our own Language: It is Mr. <hi>Borroughs</hi> his Book called, <hi>The Rare Jewel of Chriſtian Contentment:</hi> where enough is ſaid upon this Argument, upon the due digeſtion of which there will be found nothing wanting but <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er on our ſide;</hi> for the great Work muſt be the Lords: who alone can bow and change the Will of Man, and work it into a compliance with the Will of God. Our <hi>Paſſions,</hi> ſince Man in the Fall loſt the Reins and Government of them, are
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:62919:68"/> grown too hard for our Reaſon: I ſhall onely tell you, <hi>That a Diſcontented Spirit is the Devils great Advantage in the forcing of this Dreadful Temptation.</hi> No Man can poſſibly be under the power of this Impreſſion, but that Man onely who is perſwaded, <hi>That it is better not to be, then to be ſo Miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as he is in his preſent State and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And hence it is, that although God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Men and Women may often fall under the moleſtations of this Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet they ſeldom fall under it (I will not ſay <hi>never,</hi> but I ſay <hi>ſeldom)</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe although their Wills are not fully ſubdued to the Will of God, yet they are generally ſo far ſubdued to the <hi>Divine will,</hi> that the Devil ſeldom get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth this Advantage againſt them, ſo as they ſhall commit ſuch a Sin.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>4. FOurthly, <hi>Endeavour to promove the habit and work of Faith in your Souls, and to ſubdue Unbelief.</hi> It is the Apoſtles Exhortation, <hi>Heb. 3. 12. Take heed Brethren, leaſt there be in any of you an Evil Heart of Unbelief, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from the Living God.</hi> To depart from the Living God, is to <hi>depart from the Law of God;</hi> from the Rule which he hath ſet us to guide our Converſation: <hi>Thou ſhalt do no Murther,</hi> or <hi>Thou ſhalt</hi>

                  <hi>not Kill,</hi> is a part of that <hi>Rule</hi> (you know.) Now it is <hi>Unbelief</hi> which gives a Man any Incouragement to a departure from God, in any thing, much more in this: <hi>Unbelief,</hi> ſignifies a <hi>not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to the Propoſitions of the Word <hi>Revealing</hi> the <hi>Will of God:</hi> Or <hi>a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt in God for the fulfilling of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, whether relating to ſpecial Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> or <hi>ſpecial Grace,</hi> or <hi>Eternal Life.</hi> Study therfore to be Rooted and Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Faith; that you may firmly Believe theſe things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That there is a God, whoſe Right it is to Rule and Govern us, to Order us and our Affairs and Conditions, and to diſpoſe of us; and who will one day Judg us, and deal with us according to what we have done.</hi> Whoſoever it is that liveth not under this Conviction, muſt needs think himſelf <hi>in his own Power,</hi> and that he may do with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf what he pleaſeth; his Tongue is his own and he may ſpeak, his Hands are his own and he may do what he liſt, and his <hi>Life</hi> is his own and he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny himſelf in it, and throw it away as he pleaſeth; for to whom ſhould he be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for it? O therefore ſet God always before your Eyes, poſſeſs your

For it muſt be a mighty inordinate Act, and contrary to the Dictate of all Reaſon, for a Man to undertake the diſpoſal of that over which he hath no Dominion, and for the diſpoſal of which he muſt be accountable unto a Superiour. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is ſomething of <hi>Atheiſm</hi> in every Sin, but there muſt be abundance of <hi>Atheiſm</hi> in this Sin: It is impoſſible that while a Man entertaineth Thoughts to deſtroy himſelf, he ſhould fixedly believe, <hi>that he is not at his own diſpoſal as to this Life; but at the diſpoſal of God,</hi> and he ſuch a God as is to be his Judge; and whom will one day call him to Account, as well for <hi>what he hath done</hi> with the <hi>Life</hi> which he gave him, as with the <hi>Eſtate, Parts,</hi> &amp;c. which he gave him. I would therefore never have a man think that he ſufficiently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:62919:70"/> this firſt Principle of all Duty and Religion, but be ever whetting it upon his Heart: <hi>That God is,</hi> and what a God he is.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That every Man and Woman hath a Spiritual Part, an Immortal Soul, that can no more be extinguiſhed with the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, then Eat, or Drink, or Sleep with it, but goeth to an Eternal Exiſtence when it is ſeperated from the Body: Where the Body raiſed up from the duſt, ſhall one day meet it and be united to it, and with it either ſuffer Eternal Torment, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy Eternal Happineſs, according to what it hath done in this Life.</hi> Certainly no Rational Being, no Man could poſſibly entertain a Thought to <hi>Kill himſelf,</hi> if he were firmly perſwaded, <hi>That it is a thing impoſſible for him to determine his own Being.</hi> We cannot <hi>deſire</hi> nor at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to go about what we are fully perſwaded is an impoſſible atchievement. A thing impoſſible to be obtained, our Reaſon will not ſuffer our Mind to run upon, or our Hearts to run out after things which we clearly apprehend are not poſſible in Nature. Now admitting theſe Principles, That Man is ſomething more then <hi>Fleſh and Blood animated, That he hath a Spiritual Part,</hi> that this
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:62919:71"/> it is <hi>Immortal,</hi> and <hi>cannot Periſh with the Body; but when it parteth from the Body goeth into Eternal Manſions, either in Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs or in Miſery: That the Body after Death ſhall revive again in the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and there both the Soul and Body of every Man and Woman ſhall be again united and make one Perſon; and ſhall both together enter an happy or miſerable E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.</hi> I ſay admitting this, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for a Man to determine his Being, all he can poſſibly do is to <hi>determine his Being in this World.</hi> He can neither by ſuch <hi>Act</hi> determine his <hi>Being</hi> nor yet his <hi>Miſery;</hi> he may determine indeed his <hi>Miſery</hi> as to <hi>this Life,</hi> but his Soul will then but enter into a ſtate of Ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more Miſery in another World; and there will be a time after the revolution of a few years, when his Body ſhall return to Ten thouſand times more Miſery than it ever felt in this World. Now certainly no Perſon, under any command or conduct of Reaſon, can poſſibly be induced to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt a thing <hi>impoſſible,</hi> to deliver him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from any Evil: Nor yet <hi>throw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into an infinitly worſe ſtate,</hi> to deliver himſelf from a <hi>preſent bad eſtate.</hi> All the Entertainment therefore which ſuch
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62919:71"/> Temptations have in our Hearts, muſt be advantaged from <hi>Unbelief</hi> of theſe great Principles; which indeed are the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations and Principles of all Religion. Labour therefore, for as much as in you lies to Root your ſelves in the belief of theſe things, that you may not have the leaſt doubt or haeſitation of, in your Hearts with relation to them: Live in the daily <hi>Meditation</hi> of them, ſuffer not your Souls to call them in Queſtion, be acquainted with thoſe Portions of Holy Writ, where the <hi>Revelation</hi> of theſe things is cleareſt to you. Take heed of Unbelief as to theſe things.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Third thing, as to which the Soul ſhould be fully perſwaded, that will avoid the dint of this <hi>Temptation,</hi> is as to <hi>the Truth of the Holy Scriptures in the general, ſo of thoſe Portions of them in particular;</hi> which reveals the <hi>Will of God</hi> as to the <hi>preſervation of our own Lives and the Lives of others, and the Wrath of God againſt ſuch as commit Sins of this Nature:</hi> Such as thoſe <hi>Gen. 9. 6. Num.</hi> 35. 32. Thou <hi>ſhalt not Kill,</hi> No <hi>Murtherer hath Eternal Life,</hi> and all ſuch as expreſs the greatneſs of the Sin of <hi>Murther;</hi> for it is but an eaſie Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of <hi>Reaſon</hi> from theſe Principles,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:62919:72"/> If I ought not to <hi>Kill another, I ought much leſs to Kill my ſelf:</hi> If I ought to <hi>preſerve the Life of my Neighbour,</hi> ſurely <hi>I ought to preſerve my own Life:</hi> If I ought to preſerve <hi>my Chaſtity,</hi> to <hi>preſerve my Veſſel in Honour,</hi> ſurely I ought not to <hi>daſh it in pieces:</hi> If I ought not to maime or diſmember my ſelf, ſurely I ought not to deſtroy my ſelf. The truth is, no Soul can poſſibly be guilty of this Sin, who either doth not in whole disbelieve the Scriptures, or in whoſe Heart the disbelief of them doth not prevail to a very high degree at that time when he is prevailed with by any Temptation to do ſuch a thing.</p>
               <p>But there is alſo another <hi>Unbelief</hi> which muſt be predominant in the Soul at that time when it is prevailed upon by this Temptation, and that is a <hi>Diſtruſt in God</hi> for the <hi>fulfilling of his Promiſes;</hi> either with relation to <hi>ſpecial Providence,</hi> or <hi>ſpecial Grace,</hi> or <hi>Eternal Life.</hi> Thoſe who are in any Meaſure acquainted with the Holy Scriptures, know that they are full of many great and precious Promiſes, as to Eternal Life, and alſo as to this Life. As to <hi>Eternal</hi> Life, made under ſuch Conditions, and upon ſuch Terms as his infinite Wiſdom thought fit
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62919:72"/> to Preſcribe and Limit. Thoſe, as to this Life, are of various ſorts, many of them relating to an afflicted ſtate; <hi>That he will put Strength into us: That he will lay no more upon us then he will inable us to bear:</hi> That <hi>he together with the Temptation, will alſo give an happy iſſue;</hi> and many more of like import: as to which, the Soul that <hi>Truſteth God,</hi> and in which the Exerciſes of ſuch Truſt and <hi>Confidence</hi> in God, are <hi>lively, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous,</hi> can never be Guilty of this Sin; for how ſhall that Soul go about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver it out of a Miſery, which believeth that God will in his own time deliver it, and in the mean time Support, Uphold, and Comfort it, and make its Affliction iſſue in Good, and for its advantage; working for it a far more Eternal and exceeding Weight of Glory: Or how ſhall that Soul Truſt in God for Pardon of Sin, and Eternal Life, which know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that <hi>Repentance and Faith,</hi> are the ordinary means preſcribed by God for obtaining theſe things, and <hi>do the laſt Act of his Life of ſuch a Nature</hi> as leaveth no room to be renewed by Repentance; and is ſuch as God hath ſaid, None that doth it hath Eternal Life. So that as it is apparent that this <hi>Temptation</hi> is advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taged
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:62919:73"/> by nothing ſo much as <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and <hi>Unbelief,</hi> ſo there is no ſuch Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote againſt it as <hi>vigorous Habits and Acts of Faith:</hi> Nor is it poſſible that a <hi>believing Soul</hi> ſhould be under the Power and Prevailings of it, while it keepeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Conduct and Command of Reaſon.</p>

Now theſe <hi>Terrours</hi> and <hi>Pangs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> ariſe <hi>from the Souls Reflections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its Guilt in reſpect of Sin.</hi> Thus the Scripture tells us <hi>Judas hang'd himſelf,</hi> crying out, <hi>he had betrayed Innocent</hi>

                  <hi>Blood.</hi> Thus Hiſtory tells us <hi>Pontius Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> killed himſelf; and thus we Read of many others in Hiſtory. And although there be no Sin ſo little, but if God ſetteth it home upon the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and ſupporteth not the Soul with his Grace, it is able to drive the Soul to this deſperate iſſue; yet it is not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary for Sins of a more minute Nature, and ſuch as the beſt of Men commit, to be followed with ſuch horrours as ſeize the Spirit of a Man, or for Satan to take ſuch an advantage from them. The reflections which produce this effect, are uſually upon ſome Sins of a more then ordinary Tincture; and that have had ſome more eminent circumſtances of Aggravation: From whence it followeth that a <hi>Godly and Righteous Converſation, Religious</hi> towards God, <hi>Juſt</hi> and <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi> towards Men, is one of the beſt Preſervatives from the violence of this Temptation.

If we will not hearken to the lighter Checks and Dictates of Conſcience, we are often and but juſtly repaid with the ſeverer Terrours and Affrightments of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:62919:75"/> it, for our doing of ſuch things contrary to its Dictates and lighter Admonitions: But the holy Man that walketh cloſely with God, that liveth up to his Light and Revelations of the Will of God, is very much out of this danger; and though he may have ſome impreſſions of this Nature, yet they rarely are advantaged from an aking Conſcience in the ſenſe of Guilt.</p>

                  <p>Directions for them who are already fallen under this Temptation. Melancholy to be evacuated by Natural Means. <hi>2. The</hi> Motive <hi>is to be</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, which uſually is a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from ſome preſent or imminent Evil. Two things to be conſidered: 1. Whether it will free us, to deſtroy our ſelves? 2. Whether there be not
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:62919:75"/> a more ſafe and certain way to be free?</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Have thus far onely prepared you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a wreſtling with this Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and given you preventing Phyſick, (which indeed they ſay is beſt) and it is better indeed to keep ſuch an Enemy as Satan is, Armed with this Dart, at a diſtance; then to truſt to our own Strength in the hour of Combate: But poſſibly as to ſome poor Souls this counſel may come too late, the Enemy may be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: What ſhall be done in this Caſe? I ſhall conclude my Diſcourſe, referring to this Temptation with ſome Advice of this Nature.</p>
               <p n="1">1. And here my firſt Direction muſt be of the ſame Nature as before: <hi>The Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuating of thoſe Peccant Natural Humours of which the Devil takes advantage;</hi> and this at the firſt. Phyſicians will tell you, That there is a <hi>Melancholick Deliration:</hi> Melancholy may ſo far prevail, as to put a Man or Woman out of the <hi>Conduct</hi> and <hi>Guidance of his Reaſon;</hi> and who knoweth what a Man in thoſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances may do: and although it be true that Acts done in <hi>Diſtractions</hi> are not <hi>Humane Acts,</hi> and poſſibly ſhall not be
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62919:76"/> imputed to us, yet let me tell you that theſe are ſad iſſues of our Lives, and oftentimes Men and Women are ſo rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal by Times, and in ſome Acts, that it is a very hard judgment to be made by ſtanders by, whether ſuch Miſerable Creatures, doing ſuch an Act, do it under the Conduct of their Reaſon (for the avoiding of a great Miſery as they ſuppoſe, which they feel or fear) yea or no. This therefore is the firſt thing to be done in this Caſe, for the Removal of thoſe Riſes and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which the Devil takes from this Temperature of Body. When this is done,</p>
               <p n="2">2. The next thing to be attended, Is a juſt Enquiry <hi>into the Motive which the Devil urgeth to us to induce us to ſuch an Act,</hi> that ordinarily <hi>is the removing of our ſelves from the ſenſe of ſome great Evil, which either is upon us,</hi> or like ſome <hi>black cloud, hangeth over our heads,</hi> and <hi>we apprehend is not avoidable:</hi> for although we read of ſome amongſt the Heathens, that had got ſome imperfect Notions of the Immortality of the Soul, and an happy Eſtate, into which it ſhould enter after Death; out of haſt to be there, put an end to their Lives: yet there
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:62919:76"/> are no Chriſtians, but are better inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and know that although the Souls of Men and Women be indeed <hi>Immortal,</hi> and that there is a <hi>Bleſſed Eternity</hi> into which the Souls of ſome Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhall enter; yet there is alſo a <hi>Miſerable Eternity,</hi> into which the Souls of others ſhall go. And for the Bleſſed Eternity into which ſome ſhall enter, the way to it is directed by Gods Word, and not by our own Fancy; and that it is no way to do it to die in a ſinful Act, which leaveth hardly any room for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and ſpeaketh the greateſt Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief imaginable. So that, I ſay, the general Motive prevailing with any to the leaſt hearkening to this Temptation, is the removal of our ſelves from the <hi>fear</hi> or <hi>preſent ſenſe</hi> of ſome <hi>evils,</hi> which either preſs or threaten us. This being found out, certainly there can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing imagined more effectual to deliver us from the <hi>dint</hi> of this <hi>Temptation,</hi> then ſeriouſly to <hi>conſider with our ſelves. 1. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the deſtroying our ſelves will effect that end, indeed delivering the Soul from ſuch Evils? 2. Whether,</hi> ſuppoſing that it would, <hi>deliverance might not be hoped for another way; far more certain and more advantagious?</hi> As to the Firſt, <hi>A Man</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:62919:77"/> 
                  <hi>or Woman muſt be more certain of his or her happy ſtate after this Life, then it is poſſible a Soul ſhould be that doth entertain ſuch thoughts, or he can never be aſſured, that the doing of ſuch an Act ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him from the Miſery under which he groaneth.</hi> It is indeed very poſſible that a Soul ſhould be under the <hi>aſſurance of Eternal Life</hi> (whatever the Papiſts ſay) but it is impoſſible that a Soul ſhould be under this Aſſurance at the ſame time, having it in his Heart, and reſolving to do that Act, as to which the Scripture hath ſaid, <hi>That he that doth it, ſhall not inherit Everlaſting Life,</hi> or <hi>hath not Eternal Life.</hi> Now admit the Soul not to enter into Life, he certainly <hi>goes into the Lake that burns with Fire and Brimſtone;</hi> where <hi>the Worm never dies,</hi> the <hi>Fire never goeth out.</hi> For a Man or Woman to leap out of the Miſeries of this Life into the Pit of Hell, to deliver himſelf from any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Miſery, either felt or feared, is ſo wild and irrational an Undertaking, as no Soul under the guidance of Reaſon can do it, but one that believeth no Hell; ſo that it is an Act agreeing onely to an <hi>Unbeliever,</hi> or a <hi>Mad-man,</hi> an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt,</hi> or a <hi>Man Diſtracted.</hi> 2. But Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Admit now that a <hi>Man</hi> or <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:62919:77"/> deſtroying <hi>him</hi> or <hi>her ſelf, would bring him or her a deliverance from Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery in the Grave; Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>The wicked ceaſe from troubling,</hi> the <hi>weary be at reſt. The Priſoners reſt and hear not the Voice of the Oppreſſor, the Servant is free from his Maſter.</hi> So then, if Mens Souls expired with their Bodies, Death would deliver them; it freeth the <hi>Beaſt of the Field,</hi> and all ſenſitive Creatures; admit it would ſo free a <hi>Man</hi> or <hi>Woman,</hi> which it will not, yet certainly <hi>it is by no means ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, unleſs we can be freed no other way, and to no better advantage.</hi> Suppoſe a Man or Woman, under a painful fit of the Gout, or under an extremity of Pain in ſome particular Member or Joynt, ſo as the cutting off an Hand or a Leg, or a Joynt, will certainly cure him, yet who almoſt (if it be but as to the pulling out of a Tooth) will purchaſe his freedom from pain at that rate, till he or ſhe ſeeth that no other way will do. Thou art under a great degree of Miſery, <hi>great bodily Pains or Torments,</hi> or in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſome great <hi>Shame, Miſery, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach:</hi> Thou haſt a Temptation to free thy ſelf from the preſſure of it, by <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying thy ſelf,</hi> and (which is the beſt thou canſt fancy if thou beeſt an Atheiſt)
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:62919:78"/> 
                  <hi>annihilating</hi> thy Being. But is there no other way than this for thy Relief? Is there not a <hi>waiting upon God,</hi> an exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing of <hi>hope and confidence</hi> in him? Is he not able to <hi>ſupport</hi> and to <hi>bear thee up</hi> under theſe preſſures? To make thy burthen light unto thee, and to take it off thy Shoulders when he ſhall think good? Hath he not promiſed that <hi>he will not lay upon us more than he will inable us to bear,</hi> that he <hi>will be with us in the Fires, and in the Waters, that the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſhall not drown us, nor the Flames kindle upon us?</hi> If I can be delivered from an Evil, of which I am afraid, or which I feel a more certain and eaſie way, than that which I am preſſed to uſe, which is both incertain and of greater diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; doth not all imaginable Reaſon dictate to me the uſe of it? And certainly to a Soul poſſeſſed of the truth of what God hath revealed in his Word, and under the conduct of Reaſon, nothing need be added to repel ſo unnatural a Temptation as this is; whereas there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome are ſhy that perſons under the prevailing of Melancholy, ſhould read Books of <hi>

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:62919:78"/> think any Books opening the Scriptures, or any portions of Scriptures, fitter to be read, or any Sermons fitter to be heard, by perſons under theſe circumſtances, then ſuch Books, ſuch Sermons, ſuch Portions of Holy Writ, as moſt expreſs the Wrath of God againſt Sinners, moſt livelily expreſs the miſerable eſtate of Souls in another World under the Wrath of God: Together with ſuch as contain or explain the Promiſes of God, for Support, and Strength, and Help under, and Deliverance from, the greateſt Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Affliction and Miſery. By the <hi>reading</hi> and <hi>hearing</hi> of the one (the Grace of God concurring) which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways requiſite to make the Soul believe what it reads and hears, a Soul ſhall be deterred from ſuch an undertaking from the rational conſideration, <hi>That there is no way for it to get out of its Miſery;</hi> and by the other, it ſhall be perſwaded that there is a far nearer and more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain way of Relief for it, if it can but exerciſe a little Patience from the good hand of God, who is able to relieve it, and who hath promiſed, and is faithful. Which two points are of very great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port for a Soul to be perſwaded of, that it may ſtand againſt this fiery Dart,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62919:79"/> and of that Nature, that it is impoſſible that any Soul in the full poſſeſſion and belief of them, ſhould ever liſten to this Temptation, ſo long as it pleaſeth God to keep it in the exerciſe of its Reaſon. Let therefore every Soul under this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, make it its buſineſs to give it ſelf the fulleſt poſſeſſion of theſe Truths; for it is the <hi>Unbelief</hi> or <hi>faint Belief,</hi> of theſe things, that gives the leaſt advantage to the <hi>roaring Lion,</hi> thus ſeeking about to <hi>devour Souls.</hi> The more rooted a Soul is in the <hi>Doctrine of Eternity,</hi> both that which relateth to <hi>damned Souls,</hi> and that which relateth <hi>to ſuch as ſhall be ſaved,</hi> the more remote and difficult it will be, as to liſtning to any Temptation of this nature.</p>

                  <p>Further Directions for Souls thus tempted. The avoiding of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude. The Study and Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Nature of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, in the Matter
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:62919:79"/> of it, the freeneſs of it, the ſureneſs of it, the well ordering of it in all things.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>3. <hi>Dir. AVoid Solitudes</hi> and <hi>Solitary Places;</hi> I mentioned this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as a means to prevent prevailings of <hi>Melancholy,</hi> but let me a little farther inlarge upon that Argument. Indeed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of <hi>Solitude</hi> are by no means to be affected by Chriſtians, under the greateſt freedom of Body and Mind, tho no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more conduceth to a Souls Health and Freedom in communion with God, then ſome juſt Meaſures and Proportions of it; yet nothing is more dangerous in this hour of Temptation. I obſerve <hi>Elijah</hi> was alone when he prayed God in a fit of Diſcontent, to <hi>take away his Life;</hi> and <hi>Jonah, ch.</hi> 4. 5, 8. was in a <hi>Booth</hi> alone, out of the City, when he ſaid, <hi>It is better for me to die than to live.</hi> And our bleſſed Lord was alone when <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 6. the Tempter ſaid unto him, ſet upon the Pinacle of the Temple, <hi>If thou be the Son of God caſt thy ſelf down.</hi> Of Souls under theſe circumſtances, it is eminently true that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ecc. 4. 11. Two are better than one,</hi> and <hi>woe</hi>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:62919:80"/> 
                  <hi>to him that is alone when he falleth, for he hath none other to help him up.</hi> Theſe Acts are committed uſually by Perſons that are alone. It is therefore highly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſable to Perſons under theſe Impreſſions, to avoid giving this advantage to the Adverſary, and to thoſe who are nearly concerned in, and about Perſons under theſe Temptations to be watchful, as to this thing, eſpecially when they diſcern the Impreſſions are moſt ſtrong upon them. But having touched upon this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I ſhall add no more to it now.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Dir.</hi> Fourthly, There is nothing more proper for Souls under theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, <hi>Than to be much in the Study and Meditation of the Nature of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace.</hi> I told you before, that ſuppoſing a Man or Woman under the conduct and government of Reaſon, it is very hard to imagine what <hi>Motive</hi> ſhould poſſibly prevail upon them, to put an end unto their Lives, but the freeing of themſelves from ſo <hi>eminent Evils,</hi> which they ſuffer to that degree, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it is <hi>better for them to die than to live.</hi> Now theſe Evils I told you were either <hi>External, Afflictions and Croſſes;</hi> or ſuch as are <hi>Internals, Horrors of Mind, Terrors of Conſcience.</hi> If the Motive be a
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:62919:80"/> freedom from Evils of the firſt ſort, I adviſed before what I judged proper, <hi>viz.</hi> The Conſideration, whether the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of our Lives in that manner, would indeed free us, or rather make our Condition much worſe. And Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Whether there be not an eaſier and ſafer way to procure our ſelves ſuch an Immunity. But now, Suppoſe the Evils be of the ſecond ſort, <hi>viz. The Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and Terrors of Conſcience, from the guilt of ſin.</hi> If this be the Motive, the force of it lieth in our <hi>Ignorance or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake about the Covenant of Grace,</hi> and look as under a <hi>Temptation,</hi> to which External Miſery is the great Motive. There is nothing more proper than a juſt underſtanding of the ſtate of the Damned, and the miſery of Impenitent and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardoned Souls in the World to come: So ſuppoſing the <hi>Motive</hi> to be <hi>Horrors and Terrors of Conſcience,</hi> upon our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon Sin, there is nothing more proper for a Soul than rightly to underſtand the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> and the reading of ſuch Books, and whetting upon our Hearts ſuch Portions of Gods revealed Will in his Word, as are moſt fully expreſſive of it. Truly, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this, <hi>That there is no Sinner run into</hi>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:62919:81"/> 
                  <hi>ſuch an arrear with Gods Juſtice, no Soul ſo guilty, but by vertue of a gracious Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Redemption and Grace, which God the Father hath from Eternity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted with the Son of his Love; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemers part in which Covenant is alſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled by Jeſus Chriſt: may find Mercy with God, repenting of his Sin, and caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf upon the free Mercy and Grace of God, in and through the Merits and Satisfaction of Chriſt.</hi> Such is this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, that the moſt guilty Soul fulfilling his part in it, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of it, may be aſſured, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though its paſt ſins, cannot be made ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to have been, yet they ſhall be <hi>as if they never had been.</hi> That is, they ſhall no more condemn the Soul, then if they never had been; they ſhall not be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, they ſhall be ſought for and not found; the <hi>Righteouſneſs of Chriſt</hi> ſhall be reckoned unto the Soul, as if it were its Righteouſneſs. It is impoſſible that a Soul knowing and believing this, and living in the view of this gracious Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ſhould ever be frighted out of its Life, from the <hi>Horrors of Conſcience by its Reflections</hi> upon its guilt of Sin. Though an <hi>ignorant Perſon,</hi> that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not this, or an <hi>unbelieving Soul;</hi>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:62919:81"/> which though it may have received the Notion of it, yet cannot believe it may from this Motive be induced to a yielding to this Temptation; yet to ſpeak the truth, admiting a Soul ſure of its Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and that its Sins were ſo great as they could never be forgiven; it ſhould in reaſon rather be an Argument to a Soul, if it were poſſible, by all means ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable to lengthen out its days to the years of <hi>Meth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>lah,</hi> then to cut off an inch of that time which God will allow him. For what reaſon can prompt any Man to think the Horrors and Torments of a wounded Conſcience more intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable than the Pains that are ſuffered by damned Souls? Or what Reaſon will guid any Man to endeavour to be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented before his time? How earneſt do we find condemned Malefactors, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (tho out of all hope to be pardoned) but to be reprieved for a time; but I ſay, by reaſon of the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> this is not the caſe of any one poor Soul, to advantage this Temptation.

               <p n="2">2. Conſider again, the <hi>freeneſs of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi> It is called a <hi>Covenant of Grace, Grace</hi> ſignifieth <hi>Free Love. I will</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>heal your Backslidings, and love you freely.</hi> There is nothing to be paid for thy Pardon, all that is, is finiſhed, the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Farthing that the Juſtice of God could exact, is already paid by the Hand of Chriſt. There is <hi>nothing required of thee but an acknowledgement of thy Guilt, an hatred of thy former Ways, a reſolution joyned with an endeavour to forſake them, with an acceptance of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as thy Redeemer and Saviour.</hi> Oh this, this is that, which could a Soul, under Temptations of this Nature believe, theſe Temptations would certainly abate. We in diſtreſſes of Conſcience ſtick too much <hi>in a Righteouſneſs of our own.</hi> Let me here give you the Copy of a ſhort Letter wrote by that Eminent Servant of God <hi>Luther,</hi> to an <hi>Hermite, v. Luther. Ep. t.</hi> 1. <q>I (ſaith he) deſire to know what thy
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:62919:83"/> Soul doth, whether at laſt being weary of its own Righteouſneſs, it hath learned to breath after, and to truſt in the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt. For in our Age a Temptation of Preſumption too much prevaileth, and particularly in them, who by all means ſtudy to approve themſelves Righteous and good Men, being ignorant of the Righteouſneſs of God, plentifully and freely given unto us, by and through Chriſt. They ſo long ſtudy to work well, until they arrive at a confidence of ſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, as it were, upon their own Legs, and by their own Merits, which is a thing impoſſible. You and I have both been once of that Opinion, or rather in that Error, but now I ſet my ſelf againſt it, but have not yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered my ſelf as to it. Therefore (my dear Brother) learn Chriſt, and him crucified; learn to ſing Praiſe to him, and deſpairing of your ſelf, to ſay to him, <hi>Lord Jeſus thou art my Righteouſneſs, I am thy Sin: Thou haſt taken upon thee what was mine, and given unto me what was thine. Thou haſt taken what thou wert not, and given unto me what I was not.</hi> Take heed (ſaith he) of aiming at ſuch a degree of purity, as
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:62919:83"/> to appear to thy ſelf no Sinner, for Chriſt dwelleth in the Hearts of none but Sinners. He therefore came down from Heaven when he dwelled in his Saints, that he might dwell in Sinners. O meditate of his Love, and you will feel his moſt ſweet Conſolation. For to what purpoſe hath he died, if we could arrive at a tranquility of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience by our own Endeavours, and Tormenting of our ſelves? You will never therefore find Peace, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing of your Selves, and your own Works, and a fiducial dependance on him. You will further learn by this, That as he took thy Nature, and made thy Sins (as it were) his, ſo he hath made his Righteouſneſs thine.</q> An hour of Temptation, either of this <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> or to deſpair of <hi>Gods Mercy,</hi> as to the pardon of Sin, and the <hi>Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> of the Soul, will diſcover the value of thoſe Phyſicians, who have found out another way to relieve <hi>afflicted Conſciences,</hi> in the ſenſe of their own Unrighteouſneſs, then by preſſing the great Doctrine of the Goſpel of the <hi>Juſtification of the Soul,</hi> by the <hi>Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, reckoned to the believing Soul for Righteouſneſs.</hi> And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, Gods Abſolution or Acquittance of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:62919:84"/> a Soul from its Debts to <hi>Divine Juſtice,</hi> by the Righteouſneſs of the Son of God, <hi>reckoned, accounted,</hi> or (which is the ſame) imputed to it, as if performed by it, is of no more difficult Conception (whatever ſome pretend in the caſe) than a Creditors Diſcharge, and giving Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance to a Debtor upon his Friend or Sureties payment of the Debt; upon which the Principal is Diſcharged, as if he had perſonally paid it. Believe it, other Notions may afford matter of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in a calm time, but nothing but the Notion of <hi>Free Grace</hi> and <hi>Chriſts Righteouſneſs</hi> reckoned to us, will ſerve us in an hour of <hi>Temptation.</hi> Let us therefore rather chuſe to part with the <hi>Sun in the Firmament,</hi> or with the <hi>Light of our Eyes,</hi> than to part with this great Truth. Let ſome truſt in <hi>Charriots,</hi> ſome in <hi>Horſes.</hi> Let ſome truſt in the <hi>Works of others,</hi> ſome in their own <hi>Fancies;</hi> but let us remember the Name of the Lord of God, and let us remember that his Name is the <hi>Lord our Righteouſneſs.</hi> When a Soul is under great Horror and Terrors of Conſcience, becauſe of its Guiltineſs, its <hi>former guilt of Sin,</hi> let the Sin be what, and of what Nature it will. Oh let it remember that Chriſt was given
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:62919:84"/> for a <hi>Covenant for the People;</hi> he was by his Father <hi>called in Righteouſneſs,</hi> and his <hi>Hand was held,</hi> and he was <hi>kept</hi> and given for <hi>a Covenant of the People,</hi> for <hi>a Light of the Gentles, to open the blind Eyes, to to bring the Priſoners from the Priſon,</hi> and them that ſit <hi>in Darkneſs, out of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Houſe; Iſaiah</hi> 42. 6, 7. Let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that he is to ſay, <hi>Iſaiah 45. 24. Surely in the Lord I have Righteouſneſs and Strength.</hi> That if he had never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted thoſe Sins, which now ſo lie upon and load his Conſcience, yet he could never have ſtood before God in his own Works, and in a legal Righteouſneſs; but <hi>what the Law could not do becauſe it was weak through our Fleſh, that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath done, ſending his Son in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſinful Fleſh, and for Sin condemning Sin in the Fleſh, that the Righteouſneſs of the Law might be fulfilled in us; Rom.</hi> 8. 3. And let him conſider, that being he muſt be ſaved by Chriſt, and ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, as <hi>found in him, not having his own Righteouſneſs,</hi> though his Nakedneſs hath been more than the Nakedneſs of ſome other Men, yet that <hi>long white Robe</hi> is large enough to cover it; for the <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt,</hi> his Merits, are of vaſt and infinite Vertue; as the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> ſay
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:62919:85"/> of Gods Eſſence, that it filleth Heaven and Earth, and an <hi>infinite ſpace beyond both.</hi> So the Merits of Chriſt have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated for the Sins of all that ſhall be ſaved, and have an infinite Vertue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond. Therefore there is no reaſon for a Soul to concluds its <hi>Sins ſhall not be forgiven, or its Horrors of Conſcience for them never ceaſe:</hi> thoſe ceaſe of courſe upon the <hi>ſenſe of pardon,</hi> or a <hi>good hope through Grace.</hi> It is but a <hi>Relique of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi> that tortureth Mens Conſciences paſt cure, I mean an Opinion lurking in us, <hi>that we muſt our ſelves ſatisfie the Juſtice of God;</hi> and that upon the price paid, and ſatisfaction given by Chriſt, pardon doth not <hi>proceed freely;</hi> for <hi>all Sin,</hi> and <hi>all Blaſphemy,</hi> to a Soul ſeeking for it, by earneſt Prayer, true Sorrow for Sin, and reſolution againſt it, and a true ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Again, Study the <hi>Sureneſs of this Covenant.</hi> It is a Covenant of <hi>Salt,</hi> as well as a Covenant of <hi>Peace.</hi> Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with <hi>Day and Night,</hi> ſhall ſooner ceaſe; it containeth the <hi>ſure Mercies of David.</hi> It cannot fail, God cannot ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>his Faithfulneſs to fail, he cannot alter the thing that hath gone out of his Lips.</hi> The failure of Covenants amongſt Men,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:62919:85"/> is rooted in their <hi>Variableneſs</hi> and <hi>Muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi> their want of <hi>Fore-ſight</hi> and <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of future Contingencies,</hi> &amp;c. no ſuch thing can be as to this Covenant. He is the Lord that changeth not, his Name is, <hi>I am,</hi> he had a perfect and certain <hi>Proſpect</hi> and <hi>Fore-ſight</hi> of all that could happen.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Finally, Meditate of it as a <hi>well ordered Covenant.</hi> It is true, The <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace</hi> hath its Conditions to be fulfilled on our part. Such as are <hi>the taking hold of it,</hi> mentioned <hi>Iſ.</hi> 56. 6. which cannot be without <hi>ſeeking the Lord while he may be found, calling upon him while he is near; the wicked Man forſaking his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and his returning to the Lord; Iſaiah</hi> 55. 6, 7. and <hi>perſeverance in the</hi> ways of God, is <hi>another condition</hi> to be performed. But as to thoſe, it is in this <hi>well ordered.</hi> That there are <hi>Branches</hi> in the ſame Covenant, wherein God hath promiſed: 1. To <hi>work thoſe Conditions in us;</hi> that is, we doing what in us lies by Vertue of that Common Grace, which he denieth to none, or by Vertue of thoſe <hi>ſpecial Habits,</hi> which he will pleaſe to work in us, not to be wanting in thoſe further Aids and Aſſiſtances of his Grace,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:62919:86"/> by which we ſhall be inabled to do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he hath required of us: in order to the obtaining the promiſed end of our Hopes in the Salvation of our Souls. 2. That <hi>that thoſe Failings which we ſhall be guilty of through Humane Infirmity, though they may cauſe us ſorrow in the Fleſh, yet they ſhall not fruſtrate the Promiſe and Covenant of God,</hi> he will yet <hi>heal our Backſlidings and love us freely.</hi> Now the Covenant of Grace being thus rightly underſtood and apprehended, I would fain underſtand what room can poſſibly be left in a Sinner for Satan to faſten this fiery Dart, with any effect upon the Soul. I will ſuppoſe a Soul under the greateſt Terror imaginable, for Sins of the <hi>higheſt</hi> nature. Why ſhould he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy himſelf, if there be hope in the God of Heaven, concerning ſuch Sinners? If all <hi>Sin and Blaſphemy,</hi> whereby a Man ſhall <hi>Blaſpheme,</hi> may be forgiven him? Is God a Righteous God that <hi>loveth Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>can by no means clear the guilty?</hi> Why yet ſhould he do it, if he hath provided the Soul a <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> whereby it may ſtand Righteous before God, acquitted form all manner of Guilt, and out of all danger of Condemnation? What if it hath formerly been without
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:62919:86"/> 
                  <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> and be yet without <hi>Strength or Ability</hi> to any Act of <hi>Righteouſneſs;</hi> if the Righteouſneſs wherein it muſt ſtand before God, be not any <hi>perſonal Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of its own,</hi> but the <hi>Righteouſneſs of Chriſt reckoned to it for Righteouſneſs?</hi> Is it tormented <hi>through fear of future Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, the prevailings of Temptations, or its own Corruptions?</hi> Yet why ſhould the poor Creature run himſelf out of the World upon this fright, when the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace is ſo <hi>well ordered,</hi> as there is in it a ſufficient Proviſion made for it, both for Aſſiſtance againſt the prevailings and dominion of Sin, to that degree, as to ruin the Soul to Eternity, and as to that degree of Guilt, which every Soul through Ignorance, <hi>Infirmity, pure or mixt,</hi> runs into, for the <hi>heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of its Backſlidings.</hi> What is here left for a ſinful Soul to do, but to uſe the means of Grace, to apply it ſelf unto God by <hi>Faſting</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> to conſider its ways, and what in it lies to turn to the Lord, to be ſenſible of its Sins, and to truſt in the Lords Mercies, taking heed to it ſelf that it ſin no more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly; abſtaining from all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of Evil, ſtudying to perfect Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the fear of God; and daily to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:62919:87"/> its Repentance and Faith in Chriſt, as it diſcerneth its Sins are renewing every day. To what purpoſe doth a Soul under ſuch gracious and hopeful Circumſtances think of deſtroying it ſelf, and aſſerting its own Eternal Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or at leaſt making its Salvation very uncertain, which it ſhould rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to make ſure, by an Holy Life and Converſation. So that, I ſay, admit <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of Conſcience</hi> for <hi>Sin</hi> to be the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Satan makes uſe of to inforce this Temptation, nothing can be more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for a Soul exerciſed under the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, than to ſtudy, underſtand, lay hold on, make application of, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Covenant of Grace; and often to repeat to it ſelf that of St. <hi>Paul, Rom. 8. 34, 35. Who is he that condemneth?</hi> Or what ſin is that which can condemn me? <hi>It is Chriſt that died, yea rather that is riſen again,</hi> who is even <hi>at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh interceſſion for us, who ſhall ſeparate us from the Love of Chriſt?</hi> But this is enough to have ſpoken upon this Argument.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>5. FIthly, Let Chriſtians under the <hi>Impetus</hi> of theſe Suggeſtions take heed <hi>of keeping the Devils Counſel,</hi> or <hi>admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> any <hi>Parley</hi> or <hi>Deliberation with him about this point of hearkening to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> May it be the lot of any of our Souls at any time to come under ſuch Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions? Oh let us never <hi>conceal them from our Faithful Miniſters,</hi> nor from our <hi>Chriſtian Friends,</hi> nor from our <hi>neareſt Relations:</hi> Not from the firſt and ſecond, becauſe they are the <hi>Ordinance</hi> of God unto us, to give us Spiritual Counſel
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:62919:88"/> and Aſſiſtance; to ſhew us the unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of the Motion, the danger of the Temptation; it is their work to <hi>Pray</hi> with us and to <hi>Pray</hi> for us: It is the work of the Miniſter to Interpret and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to us the Mind and Will of God. A Brother, a Spiritual Friend, is born for an hour of Adverſity: The <hi>Temptation,</hi> while diſcovered, will preſs us harder, and we ſhall the leſs know what to ſay to the Tempter, and how to Reſiſt our great Adverſary; nor ſhould we conceal our ſelves from our neareſt <hi>Relations;</hi> for though they ſhould not be ſo able as an Intelligent, Godly Divine, or Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtians; to fortify us with Reaſons, and Arguments, yet they will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to <hi>Watch</hi> us, eſpecially when they diſcern the <hi>Impreſſions</hi> more violent, for ſometimes Impreſſions of this nature are ſo violent and ſtrong, that they hurry poor Creatures to a preſent deſtroying of themſelves, and the Wicked Action is done in a Moment. And again, Chriſtian, If thou wouldeſt be able to ſtand againſt this Fiery Dart; never admitt <hi>a Parly or Deliberation with the Tempter about it,</hi> That Soul is in a great degree Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that is prevailed with to deliberate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an Action ſo apparently contrary to
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:62919:88"/> the Revealed Will of God. <hi>Get thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind me Satan,</hi> was Chriſts Anſwer to the Tempter; <hi>Luke 4. 8. When he Tempted</hi> him to <hi>Worſhip him:</hi> He would not ſo much as once think upon the Motion.</p>
               <p>6. Sixthly, Let <hi>Chriſtians</hi> under theſe <hi>Aſſaults give their Thoughts as much law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Diverſion as they can.</hi> I ſay lawful, for we muſt take heed of caſting out one Devil by another; but there is lawful Diverſions enough, ſuch are viſitings of good People, diligent Attendance upon our honeſt Labours in our Callings, giving our ſelves any honeſt Imployment, by our Exerciſe in which, our Thoughts may be taken off from fixing upon the Impreſſions made upon them. I have often ſeen it, that Perſons under theſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances have been very hardly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to this; but it is Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens duty in theſe Caſes in a thing which (as this is) is within their power, and onely contrary to their humour to force themſelves, and if in this they be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is a Preſumptuous Sinning.</p>
               <p>7. Seventhly, I know not what I ſhould ſay to that piece of Advice which ſome give Souls under theſe Aſſaults. <hi>Not to ſhun</hi> the <hi>ſight,</hi> or <hi>handling,</hi> or coming
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:62919:89"/> near any <hi>Inſtruments, or Means which they may make uſe of to deſtroy themſelves,</hi> as <hi>Knives, Ropes, Wells, Precipices;</hi> &amp;c. It is true, it is good for us to go on in our ordinary way truſting in God, and not <hi>fearing</hi> the Tempter; but in an hour when the <hi>Impreſſion</hi> is <hi>very ſtrong upon the Tempted Soul:</hi> Whether it be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſable or no I cannot tell, for Chriſtians thus Tempted, to come too nigh Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices or Places of deep Waters, or ſuch Inſtruments as they may make a ſudden uſe of, to do himſelf or herſelf Evil; at leaſt not without a cloſe and narrow Watch upon them: for the truth is, in the heat and violence of ſuch Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, Men and Women oft times have little uſe of <hi>their Reaſon.</hi> As to this thing therefore I think Chriſtians ought to Rule themſelves by the Circumſtances of the preſent hour, and this cannot be fixt for a general Direction: I will add but one thing more, and with that ſhut up this Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>8. Let <hi>ſuch Chriſtians above all others, keep cloſe to the uſe of all Means of Grace,</hi> whether more <hi>Publick</hi> or more <hi>Private.</hi> The Means of Grace are <hi>the Word,</hi> the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and <hi>Prayer.</hi> The Word is to be <hi>Read</hi> and <hi>Heard.</hi> We Read the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:62919:89"/> 
                  <hi>pure Word of God</hi> without any thing of Mans Invention: This hath been mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Powerful. The Story of <hi>Aguſtine</hi> I have told you of, who under great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, and Terrour of Conſcience, was Relieved by Obeying a Voice he thought he heard out of the adjoyning Room, <hi>Tolle &amp; Lege,</hi> Take up the Book and Read; upon which he took up a Bible by him, and Read what God Bleſſed to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. The <hi>Word Preached</hi> hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Mans Mixture, but if faithfully opened and applied, is <hi>Gods Ordinance</hi> for the Staying and Comforting of People. The Miniſter is Gods <hi>Interpreter,</hi> and he ſhould be one of a Thouſand. I look upon it as the great Miſery of Souls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe Temptations, they can ſeldom be perſwaded to Read, or to <hi>hear the Word;</hi> and verily where it is thus, the Devil hath prevailed a great way. I would that ſuch Chriſtians would ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly think what they do in neglecting Means of Grace in their power to uſe, if they expect any help from God. Nor would I have ſuch a Chriſtian neglect a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> if he be one that hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly declared his Right: Theſe Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations while yeilded to, are our Miſery not our Sin; who knows whether God
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:62919:90"/> may not Bleſs the <hi>Sign and Seal</hi> of a <hi>Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Crucified Chriſt,</hi> for them to let them know there is no Reaſon they ſhould Kill or Crucifie themſelves. But above all, let them not omit <hi>Conſtant Fervent Prayer,</hi> and that both Ordinarily and more <hi>Solemnly.</hi> Great is the force of Prayer, it calls in the help of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty; both <hi>for a Deliverance</hi> from the Tempter in his own time, and <hi>for his Aſſiſtance</hi> and upholding the Soul while it pleaſeth him to keep the Soul, in this Spiritual Combate.</p>

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:62919:91"/> I cannot agree with <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and others, who Interpret theſe Words into a <hi>full Confeſſion of Sin,</hi> onely they ſay it was too late (but true Repentance is never too late) I ſhall in my Diſcourſe conſider the Words as you have them in the Margents of your Bibles, deſigning onely to make uſe of them to diſcourſe as to the great <hi>Temptation to Deſpair.</hi> In my Diſcourſe upon which I ſhall firſt Conſider,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>The Nature of the Temptation in it ſelf. 2. The Tempters inforcing it. 3. The means ordinarily made uſe of, in the inforcing of it. 4. The moſt probable means to be uſed for getting a victory over it.</hi> As to the firſt,</p>
               <p>I have already told you, That every Evil <hi>Temptation is a Motion or Solicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Soul to Sin,</hi> which when it is more Importune and Impetuous, we uſually call a <hi>Temptation;</hi> but let us more particularly inquire into the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this Sin of <hi>Deſperation.</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair in the general Notion of it, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth a <hi>caſting away of all hope, as to the obtaining of ſome good which we deſire;</hi> and ſo the Object of it may be any good thing of which we are not poſſeſt, but may be the Object of our Deſires or
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:62919:92"/> Hope. Thus we may <hi>Deſpair</hi> of Life, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 8. of Health, of Succeſs in Buſineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but in the Notion I am now ſpeaking to, it muſt he limited to the greateſt <hi>Spiritual Good,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Pardon of Sin, Living with God in Glory another day; &amp;c.</hi> And here again we muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Deſpair,</hi> for although there be no <hi>Deſpair</hi> without <hi>high degrees of Fear,</hi> yet there may be <hi>Fears,</hi> great degrees of Fear (which may produce ſome Phraſes of Deſpair, or Fits, or Paſſions of it, where yet there is no fixed Deſpair: <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair</hi> (in the Notion of it to which I am now ſpeaking) <hi>Is a Souls total, fixed, permanent, Want and Rejection of all Hope, as to the Pardon of Sins in this Life, or any happy Eſtate in the Life to come.</hi> When (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) there remaineth nothing in the Soul, <hi>but a certain dreadful locking for, of Judgment, and fiery Indignation to devour them as the Adverſaries of God, Heb.</hi> 10. 27.

                     </gap>ſperate Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, Blaſphemy</hi> againſt God, always with intollerable <hi>Horrour</hi> and <hi>Terrour of Conſcience:</hi> But we are not at preſent ſo much Conſidering it, in the <hi>Effects</hi> and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:62919:92"/> 
                  <hi>Iſſue</hi> of it, as in the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>firſt Riſe</hi> and <hi>Beginning of it.</hi> The next thing we have to conſider is, the <hi>Efficient Cauſes</hi> in this great <hi>Temptation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have ſhewed you that every <hi>Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Sin,</hi> is from <hi>our own Luſt,</hi> the <hi>Devil,</hi> or the <hi>World.</hi> The Men of the World have rarely any conſiderable Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency in this Temptation; it is not often we hear them telling us, That we have ſinned <hi>beyond hope of Mercy.</hi> They rather err on the other hand. The two ordinary Efficient Cauſes in this Temptation, are <hi>our own Luſt,</hi> and <hi>our grand Adverſary the Devil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Our own <hi>Luſt,</hi> Our <hi>depraved hearts</hi> are enough under ſome circumſtances, which we may be under, to ſuggeſt to us very unworthy thoughts of God, and highly derogatory to his Honour and Glory. For though in a <hi>quiet calm ſtate,</hi> our Luſt ſuggeſts ordinarily other things to us, yet all the Luſt that is in our Hearts doth not diſcover it ſelf at the ſame hour: We ſhall find Luſts ſtirring in us in an hour of Proſperity, of which we ſhall hear nothing in an hour of great Tribulation and Adverſity: And ſo on the other ſide, we ſhall find thoſe Luſts ſtirring in us in a time of great Affliction
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:62919:93"/> and Adverſity, which we diſeerned little of in the halcyon days of our Proſperity. When Men come to be under great preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Afflictions, then thoſe who in Health could think of nothing but their <hi>Senſual Satisfactions</hi> or Worldly Buſineſs, begin to be at leiſure to think of Dying, and of the Eternal State of Souls; and tho ordinarily our Luſt enclineth us ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to preſume, and groundleſly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy Good rather than Evil to our ſelves; yet I do not know but under ſome cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, our Hearts, that of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are no better diſpoſed to give God the Glory of his Mercy, then of his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice may (though the Devil ſtand by) ſuggeſt to us black and hard thoughts of God, which may produce <hi>Deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. But where the Impreſſions are <hi>fixed</hi> ſtrong, and <hi>abiding,</hi> and the Soul (though out-reaſoned) refuſeth to be comforted, or to entertain any better thoughts of God, but rather is more ſtubborn and pertinacious; and blaſphemeth God, I ſhould ſuſpect a great praedominance of a <hi>Praeternatural Cauſe,</hi> and the Soul under the Violence of Satan; for we are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally inclined to hope well for our ſelves, and to lay hold of every good word that looketh that way.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:62919:93"/>3. Poſſibly, <hi>The Devil may alſo in this Temptation joyn with our own Luſts,</hi> and the Temptation may be mixt; from one or both theſe Cauſes are theſe Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and this ſinful Habit is begun and perfected in our Souls.</p>

               <p>THe greateſt difficulty is to reſolve with what Bait it is poſſible ſuch an Hook as this is, ſhould be baited; for whereas the Apoſtle telleth us (as I have formerly opened to you) That every one is tempted when he is <hi>drawn away by his</hi>

When God ſaid to them, <hi>With-hold thy Foot from being unſhod, and thy Throat from thirſt;</hi> ſaid, <hi>There is no hope,</hi> no, <hi>for I have loved Strangers, and after them I will go.</hi> But now for a <hi>Sorrowful Deſpair,</hi>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:62919:94"/> for a Soul having this Grace and Hell in Proſpect, it may look for a great Riddle. What <hi>appearing Good</hi> ſhould be a Motive to him to <hi>conclude</hi> there is <hi>no Mercy in God for him,</hi> no poſſibility of Eternal Salvation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What if we ſhould ſay, That the appearing Good, that enticeth him to theſe thoughts, is, <hi>To ſpeak the truth of himſelf, and not to flatter himſelf with idle and vain hopes,</hi> as he now thinks he hath done too long. You know we are naturally deſirous to know our own Fate or Fortunes, as we call them: What ſhall become of us or betide us in the latter end? And though we are willing enough ſometimes to flatter our ſelves, yet there is a time when we deſire the contrary.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, Is not the <hi>appearing Good in ſome a rooted Malice and Hatred againſt God, and the Satisfaction of that by dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating from his Goodneſs and Mercy?</hi> This is indeed of all the moſt dreadful Account that can be given: That Soul is in the Suburbs of Hell it ſelf, to whom it is a ſatisfaction, when it can do no more, to Blaſpheme and ſpeak Evil of God. I had rather aſſign the former, as the moſt ordinary <hi>appearance of Good,</hi> ſeducing the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:62919:95"/> Soul into this Guilt. It now pleaſeth the Soul that thinks it hath deceived the World ſo long, by walking in a vain ſhew, to know and ſpeak the truth of it ſelf, as it thinketh in its Heart, through the Seduction of Sathan; but ſtill it muſt be enquired what the Devil can poſſibly ſuggeſt to a Soul to debauch it into ſuch a miſapprehenſion of God, and ſad Opinion of it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Now there being nothing in Nature that can alienate God from the Soul, but Sin, the guilt of the Soul and its ſtate before God, by reaſon of Sin, muſt needs be that and that onely, which the Devil can mount this great Gun upon; and this is that which <hi>Cain</hi> ſaith, <hi>Mine Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is greater then it can be forgiven.</hi> But before I come to ſpeak of that, let me a little take notice of ſome other Propoſitions, which many grave Divines take to be moſt certain truths, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers think ſerve the Devil in great ſtead, in order to his inforcing this great Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation. Let me digreſs a little, to judge whether indeed the guilt of thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions be according to the cry by which they are accuſed. They are thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Doctrine of Predeſtination, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> and <hi>the neceſſity of Special Grace,</hi>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:62919:95"/> in order to Salvation. I intend not to argue the truth of the <hi>Propoſitions</hi> on either ſide (that were too large a Work) but onely to conſider whether the Devil can uſe, what by ſome eminent Divines (as to them) is aſſerted, as advantages for this fiery Dart. I remember <hi>Scultetus</hi> in his <hi>Annals,</hi> tells us a Story of an honeſt ſtudious Young Man in <hi>Cambridge</hi> (whom 'tis believed the Papiſts made away) <hi>That he was found hang'd in his Study, with his Finger laid upon a Bible, opened before him, upon a Text uſually brought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm Predeſtination.</hi> But the Fiction ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained not that credit for which it was deviſed, to induce the World to believe, that his imbracing the Doctrine of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination</hi> put him upon that deſperate Practice. But to the Matter.</p>
               <p>1. It is true many great and eminent Divines have thought, <hi>That God hath paſſed an Eternal Decree concerning the future ſtate of all Men and Women, chuſing ſome to Eternal Life, paſſing by others.</hi> Suppoſe we ſhould put it to the higheſt pitch, <hi>Determining others to Eternal Death.</hi> I intend not, as I ſaid before, to diſpute what is truth in this; certain it is, God <hi>from oll Eternity fore-knew</hi> the <hi>Eternal Iſſues</hi> of all, if ſome can conceive <hi>how God</hi>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:62919:96"/>

It is not my Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to intermingle my ſelf in their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, but ſuppoſe the one Opinion or the other, I would gladly underſtand what advantage the Devil can take from the one or the other, as to this Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Some Divines indeed do ſay, That <hi>God ordained ſome to Eternal Life, out of his own good pleaſure, in and through Chriſt, without any conſideration of their Faith and good Works fore-ſeen, as moving him ſo to predeſtinate them;</hi> but with all he predeſtinated them to obtain this Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation, <hi>in the Exerciſes of Faith and Holineſs, without which they were never to ſee the Lord.</hi> But do any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines ſay, That <hi>God ordained any to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Death,</hi> or <hi>paſſed over any</hi> in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Counſel, <hi>who ſhould be damned,</hi> otherwiſe then upon the <hi>juſt demerits of their preceding ſins?</hi> Yes, it may be (will ſome ignorant Perſons ſay) they that hold an <hi>abſolute</hi> Decree, hold <hi>Election of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:62919:96"/> and <hi>Reprobation of Perſons.</hi> They do indeed hold an <hi>Election of Perſons,</hi> in the ſenſe I before opened, that the <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen Faith and Holineſs of none moved God to ordain them</hi> to Life. They do alſo believe that God hath a <hi>Jus Abſolutum,</hi> a Soveraign Power over his Creatures, as the <hi>Potter over the Clay.</hi> But they ſay that God doth not in the Condemnation of any Sinner uſe this, but onely uſeth a <hi>Jus Ordinatum,</hi> and proceedeth accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Law. <hi>The Soul that ſinneth ſhall Die:</hi> Which now being ſuppoſed, I would gladly know what Argument Satan draws from hence to perſwade any to Deſpair? He can Suggeſt to the Soul, <hi>That it is a Reprobate;</hi> and cannot the Soul Anſwer, That it is more then the Devil knows: That there is no Soul but that which <hi>ſinneth ſhall Die;</hi> ſo that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all ſaid upon rhis Argument. <hi>The Guilt of Sin is all that remaineth to the</hi> Devil to object, to drive unto De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair.</p>
               <p>It is true, that concerning the Extent of the <hi>Death of Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>to Perſons,</hi> there are various Opinions, ſome think he <hi>equally died f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>YOu have heard the Nature of this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, you have alſo heard from whence <hi>Temptations</hi> of this nature come, <hi>what ſeeming good</hi> enticeth the Soul to
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:62919:98"/> liſten to them, and alſo <hi>what Arguments</hi> the Tempters have alone to uſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force them. Let me now come to ſhew you what is to be done by Chriſtians in order to the repelling and reſiſting of them. And becauſe, as I told you in my Diſcourſe referring to the former; Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention is the beſt way, let me firſt adviſe what is proper to all of us, upon whom this hour of Temptation is not come, that we may never fall into this ſnare of the Devil.</p>
               <p n="1">1. And here let me firſt commend to you all, <hi>a ſound and diſtinct Knowledge of the Truths of God.</hi> The Devil in an hour of Temptation, hath a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage upon an ignorant Perſon, above what he hath upon a knowing Chriſtian. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us true, <hi>That a Soul ſhould be without Knowledge is not good.</hi> He that hath a ſound and diſtinct Knowledge of the <hi>Nature of God,</hi> the <hi>Doctrine of Faith,</hi> the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> and the <hi>Promiſes of the Word of God,</hi> ſeldom falls into, or lieth long under this <hi>Temptation.</hi> How eaſie a thing it is for the Devil to fright ignorant Souls, with telling them, <hi>They are not Elected,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt did not die for them,</hi> that <hi>their Sins are too many or too great, or have been too long continued</hi>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:62919:99"/> 
                  <hi>in to be pardoned;</hi> or that they have <hi>not truly repented or believed,</hi> or that they <hi>have ſinned the unpardonable Sin;</hi> or an hundred ſuch things. O do not ſlight Knowledge, no not a notional Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the things of God. You are not able to prophecy of what uſe it will be to your Souls in an hour of <hi>Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> A knowing Chriſtian may be tempted, and it may be ſome time before he can get his Hand upon the Sword of the Spirit (which is the Word of God) to draw it out for his purpoſe; but if he hath it by his ſide, if he be mighty in the Scriptures, he will have no long work with an Enemy of this kind. I pity ſuch as cannot read, or if they can, yet have loſt their time, and not improved it to learn the Scriptures, be acquainted with <hi>Catechiſms,</hi> which ſhould ground them in the <hi>Doctrine of Faith.</hi> Thou that deſpiſeſt Knowledge, neglecteſt, yea, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeſt thy own Soul, and all its Peace and Comfort, and ſeemeſt to preſume upon a Miracle, to be ſhewed for thee in an hour of Temptation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>Take heed of going on in a courſe of Sinning, eſpecially againſt thy Light and Checks of Conſcience. Invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Sinning,</hi> and <hi>prodigious Sinnings,</hi> and
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:62919:99"/> 
                  <hi>Sinnings againſt Light,</hi> and <hi>Checks of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> and particularly ſome <hi>Sins,</hi> and ſuch eſpecially as come neareſt to the <hi>Sin unto Death,</hi> give the Devil very <hi>high and great advantages,</hi> as to this Temptation.</p>
               <p>1. I ſay firſt, <hi>Inveterate Sinning.</hi> When Sin hath grown up with a Man from his youth, he hath lived and walked, and wallowed in it many years, it makes the Devil a great Market. We find it hard to believe that God, who can have from us but the homage of a few days or hours, will forgive us the Sins of ſo many years. It is rare that old Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are brought to Repentance and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, you ſhall moſt generally obſerve, that if God changeth a Man or Womans Heart, it is either in their Youth, or middle Age, ſeldom in <hi>Child-hood,</hi> and ſeldom in <hi>Old Age;</hi> and if in Old Age, they are ordinarily infeſted with great Temptations. Take heed of Sin grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Old in thy Soul: <hi>An old habit is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put off. How can you that are accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do Evil, do Well?</hi> An old Ulcer is hardly Cured; beware of growing Old in any Sin.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Take heed of any kind of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Sinning.</hi> There are degrees in
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:62919:100"/> Sin, all Sin is not of the ſame dy or magnitude. There are ſome Sins that more waſte Conſcience than others; now obſerve this, <hi>The greater Violence is done to our Conſcience by any Sins, the more Advantage the Devil hath from the guilt of them to raiſe a Temptation to Deſpair.</hi> For although it is as eaſie with God to Pardon the greateſt <hi>Sins</hi> as the <hi>ſmalleſt,</hi> yet we ſhall not find it ſo eaſie to believe that God will forgive the greateſt Sins as the ſmalleſt, and ſo the Devil hath the greater advantage from the Reflection upon them, to run us out of a Hope of the Divine Mercy. Fear all Sin, but above all take heed of notorious Acts of Impiety againſt God, or Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs toward Men.</p>
               <p>3. Thirdly, Take heed of all <hi>Sinning againſt Light;</hi> indeed againſt <hi>any Light,</hi> whether it be that of <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Take heed of Sinning againſt thoſe common Notions of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> which are Planted in all by Nature; againſt the <hi>Common Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Holy Spirit,</hi> by the Preaching of the Word of God; againſt the <hi>Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions</hi> of Parents or Governours, againſt the reflex Light of your own Conſcience. Sins againſt the <hi>direct</hi> or reflex Light of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:62919:100"/> Conſcience, do often Cauſe a very great <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> which is felt in the Soul; for though in the heat and madneſs of our Paſnons in our Youth, we ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times run down Conſcience, and it keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſilence a while; yet it often recoileth, and reproveth the Senſe, and ſetteth its Sins in order before it; and ſhews them to it, to a very great diſadvantage, and theſe are a kind of Sins which the Tempter often hangs much upon, in order to promove Deſpair, and putting the Soul out of Hope of Mercy.</p>
               <p>4. Particularly take heed of <hi>ſuch Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings as</hi> border neareſt upon the <hi>Sin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Death;</hi> you know that Chriſt hath told us, <hi>That all Sin and Blaſphemy, ſhall be forgiven,</hi> onely the <hi>Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt ſhall never be forgiven:</hi> And the Apoſtle hath told us; That there is a <hi>Sin unto Death,</hi> for which he did not direct the Chriſtians to Pray, that it might be <hi>forgiven their Brethren.</hi> Now Divines have much exerciſed themſelves in the finding out what this Unpardonable Sin is, nor is it to this day well deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, nor ſhall I undertake to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what it is, or whether it be any ſingle Sin yea or no. We find in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that the Tempter often maketh
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:62919:101"/> uſe of this Suggeſtion to drive a Soul to Deſpair, telling it, that it hath ſinned this Sin, and therefore there is no hope for it: The vanity of which appears from the Souls thus tempted, <hi>uſual Ignorance:</hi> What the Sin againſt the <hi>Holy Ghoſt is</hi> (as to which indeed the moſt Judicious Divines have been much at lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s to determine) or what comes neareſt to it, upon the Light we have from Scripture to help us to make a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of it; but though we cannot punctually determine in the Caſe, and it be much more eaſie to determine <hi>what it is not,</hi> then <hi>what it is;</hi> yet we have Light enough from Scripture, to ſhew us what ſinning comes neareſt to it, and it is ill treading upon the brink of ſuch a Pit. That Text, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. v. 4, 5, 6. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructeth us thus far. That it muſt be the Sin of an <hi>Enlightened Soul,</hi> one upon whom the Light of the Goſpel hath Shined, and who hath taſted ſomething of the Heavenly Gift, and been in ſome Meaſure made Partaker of the Holy Ghoſt, and Taſted the good Word of God, and the Powers of the World to come, and after this <hi>falleth away.</hi> From whence theſe things follow, That Heathens <hi>who never heard of God nor Chriſt,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:62919:101"/> 
                  <hi>be Guilty of this Sin,</hi> no nor <hi>titular Chriſtians,</hi> who never made any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of <hi>Religion</hi> or <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> nor had any degrees of <hi>Godlineſs:</hi> They muſt be ſuch as have been <hi>Enlightened, Taſted of the good Word,</hi> the <hi>Heavenly Gift,</hi> and <hi>the Powers of the World to come,</hi> and after this <hi>ſhall fall away:</hi> Yet it is plain, that all ſinning againſt Goſpel Light and Spiritual Illumination, all degrees of falling away from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of this Truth, is not this Sin. The Apoſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 26. and 29. v. ſeemeth as to this Sin, to inſtruct us fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for he is there ſpeaking of ſome, for whom there remaineth <hi>no more Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for Sin, but a certain fearful looking for of Judgment and fiery Indignation, which ſhall devour the Adverſaries:</hi> Now who are theſe? v. 26. <hi>Such as Sin wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, after they have received the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth,</hi> v. 29. <hi>Such as tread under foot the Son of God, and count the Blood of the Covenant, wherewith he was Sanctified, an unholy</hi> thing, and do deſpite to the <hi>Spirit of Grace.</hi> And this alſo agreeth with that Phraſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. v. 6. Where the Apoſtle giving a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why they cannot be renewed by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, aſſigneth this, Seeing <hi>they</hi>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:62919:102"/> 
                  <hi>Crucifie to themſelves the Son of God afreſh, and put him to open ſhame;</hi> ſo that it ſhould ſeem that to make up this Sin, to <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> after Illumination, or at leaſt having received ſufficient Means of Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miation and making ſome Profeſſion, there muſt be added, ſome eminent <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front</hi> done to, or <hi>Abuſe of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit of Grace,</hi> either by Word or Deed; and therefore our Saviour calleth it <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> againſt the <hi>Holy Ghoſt:</hi> Conſonant to this is what the Goſpel tells us of this Sin, you have the firſt mention of it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 31. If you look into v. 24. you ſhall find, That Chriſt having healed one that was <hi>poſſeſſed with the Devil,</hi> who was both <hi>Blind and Dumb,</hi> and People upon that recognizing him as the true <hi>Meſſias;</hi> ſaying, v. 23. <hi>Is not this the Son of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid?</hi> the Phariſes ſaid, <hi>This Fellow doth caſt out Devils, by Beelzebub the Prince of Devils.</hi> Chriſt confuteth them, and vindicateth himſelf by this Argument, eaſily to be diſerned and made up from v. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. <hi>I either caſt out Devils (as you ſay) by the Prince of Devils, or by the Power of God.</hi> I will make it out that I do it not by the Prince of Devils, 1. <hi>For this were</hi>

                  <hi>a Ruin to Satans Kingdom;</hi> if one <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> could be employed or would be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in caſting out another, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils Kingdome would be quickly at an end, it could not ſtand. 2. Again (ſaith he) not I onely, but <hi>your Children in my name caſt them out</hi> (for there were ſome Exorciſts amongſt the Jews, who were the Children (that is the Diſciples of the Phariſes) who though they followed not Chriſt, yet uſed his Name to caſt out <hi>Devils;</hi> as you ſhall find, <hi>Mar.</hi> 9. 38. where <hi>John</hi> telleth Chriſt, <hi>Maſter, we ſaw one caſting out Devils in thy Name, and he followeth not us, and we forbade him, becauſe he followeth not us;</hi> and as you ſhall read, v. 39. <hi>Chriſt</hi> allowed it, the like you find, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. 48, 49. So did the Sons of <hi>Sceva,</hi> Acts 19. 12. Now the Jews did not accuſe thoſe of acting by the Devil, but from the Power of God; from hence he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth, That he did not caſt out De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, as they malitiouſly charged him, by the help of the Devil, and that they were themſelves otherwiſe convinced in their own Conſciences; therefore he did it <hi>by the Spirit of God,</hi> and by that they could not but know <hi>that the Kingdom of God was come amongſt them;</hi> and ſo
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:62919:103"/> they <hi>ſpake Evil of God,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> and that out of Malice, contrary to the Conviction of their own Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Now ſaith he, <hi>Take heed what you do,</hi> this is a kind of Sin which God will never forgive, though all other Sin and Blaſphemy ſhall be forgiven; yet for you knowing that what I do I do as <hi>God,</hi> and by the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> to Perſecute me, and to Repraoch me, and that you may the better do it to aſcribe that to the <hi>Devil,</hi> which is, the Work of God done by me; this is a Sin which ſhall never be forgiven: So that according to our Saviours Words, this ſeemeth to be the Sin, That the <hi>Phariſes</hi> knowing well enough that Chriſt was God, Eternal God, and having ſufficient means to convince them of it, and that from his <hi>Caſting out of Devils,</hi> and ſeveral other Miraculous Operations which it was <hi>in the Power of God</hi> onely to do: Notwithſtanding yea againſt this <hi>Conviction,</hi> Maliciouſly Perſecuted the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and denied theſe mighty Operations to be <hi>from the Spirit of God,</hi> but ſaid they were from <hi>Beelze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub</hi> the Maſter Devil.

O therefore to prevent Temptations of this nature, take heed of all ſinning of any continuance, and going on in a courſe of Sin, eſpecially of any ſinnings againſt Light and Convictions, or againſt former Profeſſions; and eſpecially of any Malice and Hatred to the ways of God, which you either have formerly owned and acknowledged, or which your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences tell you are the right ways of the Lord.</p>
               <p>3. Thirdly, Let me again commend to you <hi>an Acquaintance, a through Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the Covenant of Grace,</hi> and <hi>the Diſpenſation of Salvation revealed to us in the Goſpel.</hi> The Deſpairing Soul hath ordinarily a <hi>Legal Spirit,</hi> and ſticks in the Covenant of <hi>Works.</hi> Remember <hi>that we are not under the Law b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t under Grace;</hi> in ſome ſenſe, not onely true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, but even the whole World, or at leaſt that part of it, to which the glad Tidings of Salvation, through the Goſpel, is publiſhed, is not <hi>under the Law but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Grace,</hi> not under a <hi>Legal Diſpenſation,</hi>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:62919:105"/> So as none can be ſaved without a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal perfect Obedience to the Law of God;</hi> but under a <hi>gracious Diſpenſation,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom. 1. 17. The Righteouſneſs of God is revealed from Faith to Faith,</hi> that is, wherein it is revealed; that the Righteouſneſs wherein a Man muſt ſtand, Juſt and Righteous before God, is not his own <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> made up of his Obedience to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements contained in the Divine Law, but <hi>the perfect Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, by God reckoned unto every Soul that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth and believeth in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who walketh not after the Fleſh but after the Spirit, minding and ſavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the things of the Spirit; which Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt is reckoned to the Soul as ſoon as it comes to <hi>own, receive, and lay hold upon Chriſt in the Goſpel, exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited and tendered</hi> unto it. The Soul well poſſeſſed of the Doctrine of Free Grace, and Goſpel Juſtification, though it may ſee frequent Cauſes for Heart-ſorrow, and Humiliation, as well for its former as for its renewing Sins, yet cannot eaſily ſee the umbrage of any ground to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, and caſt away its hope as to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Mercy and Forgiveneſs, or Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life and Salvation. But I have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:62919:105"/> enlarged upon this Argument.</p>
               <p>4. Fourthly, If you would avoid <hi>Temptations to Deſpair, take heed of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming.</hi> You ſhall obſerve in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of thoſe with whom you converſe in the World, <hi>That thoſe whoſe hopes are moſt quickly up, find them alſo ſooneſt down:</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe they are perſons that uſually have no great depth of judgement, and do not build their hopes upon good and ſufficient bottoms. So that as it is with ſome little Rivolets, whoſe Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel is but a ſmall continent, and which want depth, every good ſhowr of Rain raiſeth them, and cauſeth them to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow the Banks; but then, the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Rain not continuing, they are as quickly down: So it is with theſe Men, a little thing raiſeth their hopes, and a little thing again ſinketh them. Thus it is in the great buſineſs of Hope, as to the Pardon of Sin, and obtaining Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Some Perſons build up Hopes upon very light and unjuſtifiable Grounds; their Hope is indeed but a <hi>Preſumption,</hi> like the Graſs that groweth upon the Houſe Tops, which a little Heat of the Sun killeth. But other Souls build up their Hopes upon more ſure and wary Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, which are not ſo ſoon ſhaked.
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:62919:106"/> We uſe to ſay, that we are certain of nothing more than what we have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times been uncertain of. We are commanded to <hi>work out our Salvation with fear and trembling,</hi> and to rejoyce with trembling. Thoſe Souls that have gained their Hope by the Conqueſt of many Doubts and Fears, and Jealouſies, do not eaſily loſe it; whereas thoſe who have hatched it up with more eaſe, ſeldom keep it in an hour of Temptation.</p>
               <p>5. I know not what more to adviſe beſides <hi>Frequent Self-Examination, cloſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

Whether we live by <hi>Hope</hi> or <hi>Sight,</hi> (I mean Aſſurance) this is highly neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for that Soul, that would maintain the one or the other. Two things I would have Chriſtians much Examine themſelves upon: 1. <hi>The Grounds and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of their Hope. 2. The Abatements and Diſcouragements of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>As to the Grounds of their Hope,</hi> which (if good) muſt always be bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed in ſome Piece of <hi>Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:62919:106"/> for Pardon of Sin, and <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> being both of them the free Gift of God; it is unreaſonable to hope for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but upon the Revelation of the will of him in whoſe Gift they are. In examining therefore the Truth and Ground of your Hope, truſt to nothing but <hi>ſome portions of the Word of God,</hi> which though it doth not tell you by name whoſe Sins are pardoned, and whoſe are not, who ſhall be ſaved and who ſhall periſh, it doth tell you, what muſt be wrought in the Hearts of thoſe whoſe Sins are Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and how they muſt live that ſhall ever ſee the Face of God in Heaven; there's no truſting to your Intereſt in God, as he that made you, nor yet to Chriſt dying for all Men; no nor yet to any Merits or Works of your own. God hath no where ſaid, that he will ſave all thoſe whom he hath Created, nor all thoſe who believe Chriſt died for all Men; no, nor yet all thoſe that do ſome things, that are as to the Matter of them good, and ſuch, as if Men do not, they cannot ſee God. I ſhall not here run into particulars, but in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral I ſhall tell you, that there is nothing but the Revelation of the Will of God in his Word, and the experimental finding
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:62919:107"/> that God hath wrought thoſe things in your Souls, which he in his Word hath made neceſſary, in order to obtaining Pardon and Eternal Salvation, that is in this Caſe to be truſted to. Often there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore examine your ſelves upon theſe Points, 1. What God in his Word hath made ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the obtaining of Pardon and Salvation. 2. <hi>The Work of God upon your Hearts, Creating and Working, and Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, theſe Habits and Exerciſes in your Souls.</hi> Nay, do not onely this, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine your ſelves alſo about the <hi>holding or abating of your Hopes;</hi> the Increaſe or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and Diſcouragements of them in your Souls. A faint decaying, weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hope, if not lookt to, will grow more and more faint and weak every day than other, till it putriſieth into Deſpair. Now the force of this lies here, The decays and abatements of our Hope, are cauſed either from <hi>ſome Relapſes into Sin,</hi> or from ſome <hi>eminent with-drawings of the Holy Spirit of God,</hi> which uphold and maintaineth it in a Soul. And a daily examination or frequent examination of our ſelves how it is with us, as to our Spiritual hope, will put the Soul both upon <hi>frequent Acts of Repentance,</hi> as it diſcerneth that its hope is abated by the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:62919:107"/> prevailings of its Luſts, and alſo upon frequent Prayers, begging the revivings and upholdings of it from the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Live in cloſe Communion with God.</hi> I propounded to you before the avoiding of Sin, all Sin, but ſome eſpecially, to prevent Temptations to Deſpair. But this is ſomething more, we are at firſt begotten to a <hi>lively Hope, by the Word upon fervent Prayer,</hi> &amp;c. and this Hope is maintained in the Soul, by the ſame means by which it is firſt begotten and bred in the Soul. I told you before that we muſt find the ground and bottom of our Hope in the Word of God. Now Preaching (where it is done ſincerely and faithfully) is nothing elſe but an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi> and <hi>Application of the Word of God,</hi> an Interpretation of the Word to our Souls, and a whetting of it upon our Souls; and therefore in reaſon a conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encious Attendance upon it, muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be a means to confirm and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then our Hopes, and to antidote De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair: Nor certainly can often Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the Lords Supper be uſeleſs, but contrariwiſe of very great uſe; for the Lord in that Ordinance having added a Sign to his Word for the confirmation of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:62919:108"/> our Faith, it muſt needs be a proper means to ſtrengthen and increaſe our Hope. In ſhort, All Communion with God, whether it be more Internal by <hi>Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and the <hi>ſecret Exerciſes of the Power</hi> of our Souls upon God, or more <hi>Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> in ſuch Duties as God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed us to perform an Homage to him by, muſt be of great uſe to our Souls in this caſe. For the more Freedom and Acquaintance we have with God, the more we be with him; the truer and more juſt Apprehenſions we ſhall have of him, and the more we ſhall underſtand the loving Kindneſs of God. Now all Deſpair floweth from unjuſt and unkind Apprehenſions and Impreſſions of God, and from a too great an eſtrangement from him. It is true, thoſe that know the Lords Name, will truſt in him, and hope in his Mercy.</p>
               <p>But above all, be much <hi>in Prayer,</hi> that obtaineth all <hi>Grace,</hi> all <hi>Mercy</hi> from God; the beginnings of it, the growth and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I ſhall add no more upon this Subject, directing you to what I judge moſt proper to prevent in the Soul Fits, or more ſettled Habits of Deſpair; and certainly, it is moſt adviſable to keep Satan at a diſtance, and more eaſie to oppoſe

                  <p>What Deſpairing Souls ſhould do. They ought to conſult the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, if no Bodily Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per gives a riſe to ſuch dark Thoughts.

               </argument>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:62919:109"/>
               <p>THus far I have diſcourſed you, in order to the prevention of theſe Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults. Poſſibly as to ſome this Counſel may come too late; they may already find in their Souls Thoughts tending to <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair.</hi> The next Queſtion is, <hi>What ſhall theſe do?</hi> Or indeed rather, what ſhall be ſaid to, or done for thoſe, for their Support, Relief, or Deliverance? I know but three things that can be done for ſuch a Soul: 1. The Firſt is, <hi>With the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi> who is Gods Ordinance; the Means he hath appointed by which he healeth our Bodies. 2. The Second is <hi>with God,</hi> who alone hath a Power pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramount to <hi>Sathan,</hi> and alone can find, a way to our Hearts, and make powerful Impreſſions upon them. 3. The Third is with the Party <hi>Tempted,</hi> to perſwade him or her, of the unreaſonableneſs of the Temptation; the contrary Revelation of the Will of God in Scripture, and the uſe of Means, Natural, Moral, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, for the ſupport of him or her ſelf; and the bringing him or her ſelf out of this horrible Pit. Under theſe three Heads I ſhall bring my whole remaining Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon this Argument. 1. The firſt thing, I ſay, is to be done in this Caſe,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:62919:109"/> relates to the <hi>Phyſician.</hi> It is a thing that we find very difficult, to perſwade Souls under theſe circumſtances to believe; nay, many others too, leſs knowing Chriſtians, that there is any thing of <hi>Bodily Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> in the caſe: But there is nothing more true, nothing that is more ordinarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented. God forbid that we ſhould think that all <hi>Deſpairing Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,</hi> are the Effects of a <hi>Natural Cauſe,</hi> a diſordered Body or Head. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is evident, but that in many they are ſo; I was about to ſay, that in the moſt they are ſo; and that where they are not ſimply and ſingly the Effects of thoſe Cauſes, they are yet highly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taged and improved by the Concurrence of ſuch Bodily Diſtempers, is moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, to thoſe who have any Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in theſe things, either from what they have found in themſelves, or obſerved from their converſe with, and miniſtring unto, thoſe that have lien under theſe great Burthens. And there can be no greater Argument for this, then the frequent Experiences we have of Perſons, that in the beginning of theſe Diſtempers have had them removed, by the uſe of Natural Means: Not that <hi>God</hi> is to be neglected, for admitting theſe Fits of Deſpair, to be but the products of a <hi>Natural Cauſe,</hi> by
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:62919:110"/> the ill influence that ſome diſordered pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Humours of the Body have upon the Mind; diſpoſing it to <hi>Fears</hi> and <hi>Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, Suſpicious Diffidence,</hi> and <hi>Diſtruſt.</hi> Yet it is <hi>God that muſt heal us, by his giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Bleſſing upon Means; but the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is not about the Principal Efficient Cauſe in the Cure,</hi> which muſt be God; but concerning the <hi>Means</hi> to be <hi>uſed,</hi> and in the uſe of which God is to be ſought, and his Aſſiſtance expected. Therefore, I ſay, the firſt thing to be done in theſe Caſes, is conſulting with the <hi>Phyſician,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Health of our Bodies, and that with an Able and Experienced Phyſician; for it is an exceeding weighty Caſe, with reference to our Good and well Being. Nor ought any Means to be neglected, which ſuch a one ſhall direct for bringing our Bodies into a right Order; not yet to be uſed without ſolemn <hi>Applications to God;</hi> begging both his Direction of them, and his Bleſſing upon them. Nor ought this to be delayed, for none knoweth the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of ſuch Diſorders as theſe, and how quick a growth ſuch Beginning Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers oft times have. But this is one of the firſt things I ſhould adviſe in ſuch a Cauſe as this is.</p>
               <p>2. Secondly, Such a Soul hath alſo a greal deal of <hi>buſineſs to do with God:</hi>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:62919:110"/> The Nature of which muſt be determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>according to what it findeth to have given the firſt riſe and cauſe to theſe Thoughts:</hi> If it findeth that ſome Bodily Diſtempers hath given the firſt riſe and cauſe to theſe dark and ill concluding Thoughts: Our buſineſs with God lies, 1. <hi>In begging Gods Direction of us unto the Uſe, and Bleſſing upon us in the uſe of ſuch Means, as are proper, and he will Bleſs unto the Healing of us, and the Deliverance of us from ſo great a Burthen;</hi> that he who miniſtreth unto us, may not have <hi>a miſcarrying hand. 2. That he would pleaſe to command the Means uſed to exert and put forth that Vertue which he hath created in them for the producing that Effect we deſire,</hi> and for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which we make uſe of them. 3. That in the mean time he would pleaſe ſo to influence and to ſupport our Souls, that our <hi>Bodily Diſtempers may have no ſuch ill Influence upon our Minds, as to be occaſions to us of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honouring God, by entertaining any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Thoughts of the Divine Majeſty, Mercy, and Goodneſs.</hi> If we find that theſe black and dark Thoughts ariſe in us, or in any others, from any other Cauſe, whether our own <hi>Reflexions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:62919:111"/> 
                  <hi>our former Sinful Courſes, or ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular guilt of Sin upon us:</hi> Our Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ſtill with God by <hi>Prayer,</hi> for it is he alone, that can Pardon Sin, that can give Eternal Life and Salvation, and that can beget in the Soul a lively Hope, as to ſuch Pardon, and obtaining Eternal Life and Salvation; that can Bleſs any <hi>Spiritual Means</hi> to be uſed in order to the obtaining of any of theſe; but here the matter of Prayer and of our Petitions to God, muſt be of another Nature. That which the Soul in this Cauſe hath to do with God, is 1. <hi>To confeſs its Sin unto God, and to begg of God a broken and contrite Heart, that it may confeſs and bewail its Sin as it ought to do:</hi> When ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 32. v. 3, 4. <hi>I kept ſilence, my Bones waxed old, through my roaring all the day long; for day and night thine hand was heavy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me: my moiſture is turned into the drought of Summer. I acknowledged my Sin unto thee, and mine Iniquity I have not hid; I ſaid I will confeſs my Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions unto the Lord, and thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaveſt the Iniquity of my Sin.</hi> 2. He hath a further Work with God; <hi>viz. To begg of him the Pardon of his Sin, and the begetting in his Soul a lively Hope</hi>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:62919:111"/> 
                  <hi>in his Mercy and Godneſs.</hi> It is God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>The Father of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> which according <hi>to his abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Mercy, begetteth the Soul to a lively Hope, by the Reſurection of Jeſus Chriſt from the Dead, to an Inheritance incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reſerved in the Heavens for us.</hi> 3. Thirdly to begg of God a <hi>Bleſſing upon all Means in order to this end,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the reading, or the hearing of the Word, or any Spiritual Conference with Miniſters, or knowing and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Chriſtians, who are able to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon for the Relief of Souls that are weary and heavy laden with the ſenſe of their Sins.</p>
               <p>3. A third Work to be done for the Relief of Souls under this fore Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is with the <hi>Perſons themſelves that are Tempted;</hi> and that is, to <hi>perſwade them,</hi> or for ſuch poor Souls to perſwade themſelves, of the <hi>unreaſonableneſs of thoſe concluſions which they make againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi> Now upon this ſuffer me to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large a little in an endeavour to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the little force that can be in any Argument, that ſuch a Soul can bring againſt it ſelf in this Caſe; and in ſhew-you the exceeding ſinfulneſs of this Sining
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:62919:112"/> of Deſpair, in the firſt place let me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſuch a Soul to Conſider; 1. <hi>That there is no Argument ſufficient to warrant it to caſt away all Hope in God, as to the pardon of its Sin, and the obtaining Eternal Life and Salvation through Chriſt.</hi> The one of theſe dependeth upon the other. For if there be no Argument ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince ſuch a Soul, that its Sins ſhall never be forgiven, there can be no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument ſufficient to convince it, that it ſhall certainly be <hi>Damned;</hi> or that it is a Reprobate: for <hi>Pſal. 32. 1. Bleſſed is he whoſe Iniquities are forgiven, and whoſe Sins are covered, and to whom the Lord imputeth not Tranſgreſſion.</hi> A Pardoned Sinner cannot Periſh, that is certain: If therefore no Reaſon can be brought ſufficient to prove that God will never Pardon me; none can be brought ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for me to conclude from it, <hi>That God will not Save me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Sometimes Souls under theſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, will plead <hi>no Argument at all,</hi> onely they have ſuch a fixed <hi>Impreſſion</hi> and <hi>Perſwaſion</hi> upon their Hearts they <hi>know it,</hi> they are ſure of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this is all you can get from it. But as the Apoſtle ſaith in another Caſe, <hi>Gal 5. 8. This perſwaſion cometh not from him</hi>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:62919:112"/> 
                  <hi>that calleth you.</hi> Impreſſions upon our Spirits are no Oracles, nor muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for <hi>Arguments:</hi> Impreſſions or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions are either from the <hi>Holy Spirit of God,</hi> or Perſwaſions hatcht up in our Souls <hi>by their own Powers;</hi> or they are from the <hi>Evil Spirit: Impreſſions</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>from the Spirit of God</hi> cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, they are infallible, but ſo are not theſe: Can (think you) this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion be from him that every where in his Word calleth upon Men, to Sinners, to all ſorts and degrees of Sinners, to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and Beleeve,</hi> to <hi>waſh themſelves and make themſelves Clean;</hi> telling them that if their <hi>Sins were as Scarlet, they ſhall be as Snow; if as Crimſon, they ſhall be as white as Wooll;</hi> that he <hi>will have Mercy</hi> upon them, and <hi>abundantly Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> them? <hi>Jſaiah</hi> 55. 6, 7. Can he that calleth Sinners, all Sinners <hi>that are weary and heavy laden,</hi> to <hi>come unto him,</hi> Promiſing them <hi>Reſt for their Souls?</hi> I ſay can they poſſibly think that he hath <hi>perſwaded them</hi> that they ſhall never obtain Pardon? It muſt therefore remain, that theſe Perſwaſions in whatſoever Souls they are found, muſt either be <hi>bred in the Soul</hi> from its own <hi>Corruption,</hi> or brought into the Soul by <hi>Satan.</hi> Let them
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:62919:113"/> be from which of theſe two Cauſes they will, they are very far from being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and infallible. <hi>The Heart of Man is deceitful above all things,</hi> and the Devil was <hi>a Liar from the Beginning.</hi> Time was, it is poſſible, when the Devil drove a quite contrary Deſign, and ſang a quite other Song, to incourage the Soul in a courſe of Sin; ſuggeſting to it, that Pardon was an eaſie thing, and might be obtained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out difficulty; however he hath changed his Note now, he is purſuing but the ſame Deſign, that is, the Ruin of the Soul, though it be by a quite contrary Method. But it is not always that a Soul under this Temptation talketh at this irrational rate, ordinarily it hath ſomething to ſay, though nothing ſufficient to build ſuch a Concluſion upon; and as I hinted to you before, all that the Devil, or a Mans own Heart can ſay in the caſe, is either, 1. <hi>That our Sins are too many</hi> to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given. Or, 2. <hi>That they have been aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated</hi> with ſome circumſtances, to that <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that they cannot be forgiven.</hi> Or, 3. <hi>That the time is paſt,</hi> we have gone on <hi>in them too long to be forgiven.</hi> Or, 4. <hi>That we have committed ſome particular Sins of too deep a dy to be waſhed out.</hi> If we can but drive out the Devil from theſe Refuges, we ſhall
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:62919:113"/> leave him nothing to ſay to a Soul to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage this Temptation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to the Firſt, <hi>That our Sins are too many to be forgiven.</hi> This <hi>Suggeſtion</hi> either hath no bottom at all, or if it hath any, it muſt be this: <hi>That the Promiſes of Grace, and the Forgiveneſs of Sins, are limited to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number of Sins;</hi> for if they be not, upon what colourable pretence doth the Devil endeavour to baffle the Hope of any Soul, by whiſpering to it, That its Sins are too many to be forgiven; if God hath no where ſaid, he will not pardon a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Sins, to what purpoſe, or upon what pretence ſhall a Soul Deſpair, becauſe of the multitude of its Iniquities? But where in the whole Book of God ſhall a troubled Soul find any line to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: <hi>A Souls hope for Pardon dependeth upon the Word of God, and in reaſon muſt not the Limitations</hi> (if any be of that hope) <hi>be found in the Word of God too;</hi> or are they not in all reaſon to be rejected, as the Fictions of our own Hearts, or Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our grand Adverſary the Devil? Where the Word of God limiteth not the Will of God, upon what grounds do we limit it? Methinks in this caſe the whole Trinity ſpeaketh unto us, in the Language that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:62919:114"/> in another Cauſe; 2 <hi>Cor. 6. 11, 12. Oye, Corinthians</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>our Mouth is opened unto you, our Heart is inlarged: You are not ſtraitned in us, you are ſtraitned in your own Bowels.</hi> Some thinks the Holy Trinity ſpeaketh to us in the whole tenor of the Sacred Writing, <hi>O you trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Sinners, you Deſpairing Souls, our Mouth is opened to you,</hi> to call thoſe that have <hi>abundantly ſinned</hi> to our <hi>abounding Mercies. Our Heart is enlarged,</hi> you are not ſtraitned in me (ſaith the <hi>Father of Mercies)</hi> I have infinite Mercies, Mercies as the Sands which is on the <hi>Sea-ſhore. You are not ſtraitned</hi> in me (ſaith the Son) I have an infinite Value and Vertue in my Blood; it is ſufficient in it ſelf for the Expiation of the Sins of the whole World, and every individual Man and Woman in the World. <hi>You are not ſtraitned in me</hi> (ſaith the Holy Spirit) I after a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Sinnings, <hi>ſtand</hi> yet <hi>at the door of your Hearts and knock, and cry, if any Man will open, he ſhall come in and ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>own Bowels.</hi> They cannot find in their Hearts to <hi>conſider their ways,</hi> to <hi>humble their Soul</hi> for their ſins, to leave them, and to turn unto God: Thus are they ſtraitned in their own Bowels, and <hi>they will not come to Chriſt that they might have Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>To this Suggeſtion doubtleſs we are to oppoſe what the Scripture ſpeaketh of,</hi> the <hi>multitude and abundance of Divine Mercies,</hi> Pſal. 134. 18. <hi>If I ſhould count them</hi> (ſaith Holy David) <hi>they are more in number than the Sand.</hi> So <hi>Iſaiah 55. v. 6, 7. Let him return unto the Lord,</hi> and he <hi>will have mercy upon him, unto his God, for he will abundantly pardon.</hi> Thus you often read in Scripture, of a <hi>multitude of Mercies, tender Mercies</hi> in God; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5. 7. I will come into thy Houſe in the <hi>multitude of thy Mercies.</hi> So <hi>Pſal. 51. 1. Have Mercy upon me, O God, according to thy loving kindneſs;</hi> according to the <hi>multitude of thy tender Mercies, blot out my Tranſgreſſions.</hi> So <hi>Pſal. 69. 13. Mercy in God</hi> is but one thing, it is the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God looking upon one in Miſery, and helping and relieving him: what do we read of a <hi>multitude of Mercies,</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it either ſignifies Gods <hi>multiplied Acts of Goodneſs,</hi> which are ſeveral Branches ſpringing out of the ſame Root of <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:62919:115"/> and Mercy;</hi> or elſe the term is uſed, to ſignifie unto us, that there is a <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in God proportionated to the multitudes of Sin and Miſery that are in us.</hi> To what end do we read of multitudes of Mercies in God, if it were not to relieve us groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under multitudes of Sins.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Again conſider, <hi>It is the ſame thing with God to pardon multitudes of Sins as few;</hi> yea, he <hi>never pardoneth the Sins of any one Soul, but he pardons a multitude.</hi> God muſt vail his Juſtice, and deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his <hi>Vindicative Juſtice</hi> to pardon one Sin. There is no one Sin, but hath a kind of <hi>infiniteneſs in it,</hi> or rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts an infinite Guilt; for every Sin which we commit, is againſt an <hi>infinite God,</hi> againſt <hi>infinite Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs;</hi> and nothing but <hi>infinite Goodneſs</hi> can remit it and paſs it by. And an infinite Remiſſion as eaſily extendeth to a <hi>multitude of Sins</hi> as to a few; ſo that as that good Prince ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God in the recognition of his Power, <hi>It is eaſie with thee to ſave by many as by few.</hi> So we may ſay in the caſe before us, <hi>It is as eaſie with God to ſave from many, from the guilt of many, many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Sins, as from the guilt of a few;</hi> eſpecially (which I ſhould have put in) conſidering there is alſo an infiniteneſs in

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in <hi>the Redemption Price</hi> that is paid; if indeed that had been ſcant, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing might have been colourably object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but that is commenſurate to the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that is in God. The Perſon that died for our Sins, was <hi>God-man,</hi> an infinite Perſon; his Blood was of infinite Vertue, as to Satisfaction. Indeed the Papiſts ſtrain a great deal too far, to ſay, <hi>That the leaſt Drop of Chriſts Blood was ſufficient to ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome a World.</hi> That is an idle <hi>Monkiſh Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berbole,</hi> for there muſt be a powring out of his Life, ſo much of his Blood ſhed, as ſhould have determined his Life: But that there is a <hi>Nuda Sufficientia</hi> (we are not ſpeaking now of the <hi>Sufficientia Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nata,</hi> how far Chriſt ordained it to be ſufficient) but that, I ſay, there was a bare and naked Sufficiency in the Death of Chriſt; for more than it ſhall ever be applied to. This muſt be granted by all, who will acknowledge an infiniteneſs in Chriſts Perſon. Nor yet ſhall the <hi>Papiſts</hi> from hence augment their Churches Treaſury to the value of a Farthing. Chriſt never left the Redundancy of the Vertue of his Death to humane Diſpoſal: the Vertue of his Blood (as to all thoſe who ſhall by it have any Benefit) was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and diſpoſed of from before the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:62919:116"/> of the World; even from the time that the <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

Let them look to anſwer the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in this Point, who maintain <hi>Univerſal Redemption</hi> in the latitude of it. But I add farther under this Head, That <hi>God never pardoneth Sin to any Soul but he pardoneth a multitude.</hi> It is true, there is not a parity in Men and Womens Sins, either as to the quality or quantity; but, I ſay, <hi>God never pardons any but multitudes of Sins: The Righteous falleth ſeven times in a day.</hi> Sin is in every Soul, and it may ſay, <hi>Our Name is L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gion, for we are many.</hi> If multitudes of Sins could not be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, no Sinner could be pardoned.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Temptation. <hi>But then, ſaith the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter,</hi> or the tempted Soul (if you will) <hi>Ah, but my Sins have received very high and great Aggravations:</hi> I have ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Light,</hi> againſt <hi>Love;</hi> I knew I ought not to do what I did; I was warned by Miniſters, checkt by my own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, otherwiſe moved by the Spirit of God. I had Mercies above thouſands of others; I ſinned againſt all, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which I anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This is indeed a very <hi>ſad circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> a load of this nature doth often lie very heavy upon the Conſcience; and a
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:62919:116"/> guilt of this nature, requireth a further and deeper Humiliation, Confeſſion, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition; but the Queſtion is, <hi>Whether ſuch Sins be capable of a Pardon, yea or no?</hi> If they be capable of Forgiveneſs from a gracious God, all this is no ground for thee to Deſpair, and caſt away Hope; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to be comforted.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If they be not <hi>capable of Pardon,</hi> it muſt be ſo <hi>determined in Scripture.</hi> Now the Revelation of God in his Holy Word, hath no where determined, that <hi>no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that hath ſinned againſt his Light ſhall be forgiven:</hi> and we ought not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude to our own Prejudice and Diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, as to an Act of God, what he hath no where in his Word revealed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, <hi>There is no Sinner pardoned, but hath ſinned againſt his Light and againſt Love;</hi> ſo that the Queſtion ſeemeth not to be about the Thing, but about the Degree: not whether one who hath ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> can be Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, but whether one who hath ſinned againſt <hi>ſo much Light,</hi> and <hi>ſo much Love,</hi> can be forgiven; and it will be very hard for thee to aſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ign Sinnings againſt ſuch Degrees of Light and Love, as none ever ſinned againſt and were ſaved. There are in Scripture great inſtances of Pardoned
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:62919:117"/> Sinners, who yet ſinned againſt great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> too. Take but the inſtances of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter; David</hi> was a Man of much <hi>Light,</hi> he was, you know, one of the Pen-men of Holy Writ; he was a Man much beloved of God, he is ſtiled, <hi>The Man according to Gods own Heart:</hi> God mindeth him of how much he had done for him, taking him from the Sheep-folds, and making him King over <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah;</hi> giving his Maſters Crowns, Houſes and Wives; yea, and (as he tells him) was ready to have done greater things for him; againſt all this he ſinned in the matter of <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> and in the matter of <hi>Uriah:</hi> It is true, this coſt him many Tears, many Prayers, yet he obtained Mercy. <hi>Peter</hi> was a Man of <hi>great Light,</hi> and had been made the Object of <hi>great Love;</hi> Chriſt had ſaid to him, <hi>Thou art</hi> Peter, <hi>and upon this Rock will I build my Church;</hi> yet this <hi>Peter</hi> curſed and ſware, and denied his Maſter, and after this, when he had gone out and wept betterly, Chriſt remembred him; and I doubt not but you believe <hi>Peter</hi> is in Heaven. Thou canſt not ſay, that thou haſt ſinned againſt greater Light, or greater Love, than theſe two eminent Saints in Glory ſinned againſt. <hi>To have ſinned out our Light indeed,</hi> that
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:62919:117"/> is, to ſuch a degree as we have <hi>no more Checks, no more Rebukes of Conſcience,</hi> this is very ſad, and the <hi>Interpretations of it be to the Enemies of God.</hi> To be paſt Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that is ſad, but by thy Trouble and Complaining it appeareth that is not thy Caſe: but it is plain that many have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt Light much Light, and againſt much Love too, whom God hath from the infiniteneſs of his Mercy forgiven and rereceived up to Glory.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Temptation. But will ſuch a Soul ſay, <hi>It is true, had I in time turned unto God there might have been hope, but alas, time is paſt; time is paſt</hi> with me: had I turned to <hi>God in my Youth, but I am in the declining part of my Life; God hath ſaid, His Spirit ſhall not always ſtrive with Man. The Fig-tree was Curſed after Three years in vain expecting Fruit. God hath a long time been looking for Fruit of my Soul, and hath found none: I have ſinned wilfully, after I had received the Knowledge of the Truth, there remaineth now</hi> (I fear) no more Sacrifice of Sin, but a certain fearful <hi>looking for of Judgement and fiery Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which ſhall devour the Adverſaries; Heb.</hi> 10. 26, 27. To which, I ſay,</p>
               <p n="1">1. This is indeed <hi>a very ſad and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Reflection,</hi> and I deſire that ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:62919:118"/> as theſe, when we hear them, may be ſanctified, to all that have time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, to take heed how they miſpend it and trifle it away; but where this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel is too late, the Queſtion that we have in hand, is, Whether there be a ſufficient Warrant for a Souls Deſpair.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſadneſs (Secondly) of this Caſe is aggravated, <hi>from the appearances of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for this Temptation.</hi> It is generally held by Divines, That as <hi>Countries</hi> and <hi>Nations</hi> have their <hi>Periods of Grace,</hi> ſo particular Perſons have their <hi>Days of Grace too,</hi> and <hi>Periods,</hi> beyond which Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſhall not ſtrive with them; and it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by that Text, <hi>Heb. 10. That there is a wilful Sinning after the Knowledge of the Truth, after which there will remain no Sacrifice for Sin.</hi> But what that degree of wilful Sinning is, and how it muſt be circumſtanced, that is another Queſtion? But to ſpeak more directly to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the firſt place, I would have thee ſcriouſly conſider, <hi>Whether the Freeneſs of Divine Grace in the Remiſſion of Sins, be duly thought of by thee, who objecteſt thus againſt thy ſelf.</hi> Take heed thou haſt not ſome Thoughts within thee, that thou ſhouldeſt recompence God by thy future
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:62919:118"/> Holineſs, for thy paſt Provocations; and whether that which diſcourageth thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in God, and looking up unto him for Mercy, be not a proſpect that thou art not like to have time enough to make this Recompence: If thou haſt any ſuch Thoughts as theſe, thou doſt not well at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the Promiſe of Pardon, which runs thus: <hi>I will blot out thy Tranſgreſſions for mine own Name ſake,</hi> and we have <hi>Redemption, even Forgiveneſs of Sins, through his Blood.</hi> The end which God aimeth at in the Forgiveneſs of any Souls Sin, is <hi>his own Glory,</hi> the glorifying of the riches of his Grace, <hi>not receiving the Homage of an Holy Life,</hi> though that be thy Duty, and what God requireth of thee, yet, I ſay, that is not Gods great and ultimate end. <hi>He will have Mercy on whom he will have Mercy, and extend, Compaſſion to whom he will extend Compaſſion.</hi> The Conſideration upon which God doth it, is the <hi>Price paid,</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction given by the Blood of his Son.</hi> It is not for our ſake, nor for our future Works ſake, but <hi>for his own Name ſake,</hi> and for his dear <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n's ſake;</hi> that he granteth unto any, <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Forgiveneſs of Sin.</hi> Now although the time of thy Life yet to come, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability will not be commenſurate to the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:62919:119"/> time of Life, which is paſt and ſpent in Sinning and Diſhonouring God; yet why may not the <hi>great God glorifie the Riches of his Grace,</hi> in the free Forgiveneſs of thee? Why may he not <hi>exalt the Blood</hi> of his Son, in waſhing thy Soul?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>It is not for us to know times and ſeaſons, which are in Gods Power onely.</hi> It is true, God ſeemeth to have revealed, that <hi>every Soul hath a ſet time, beyond which be will ſhew it no favour;</hi> and that this is not onely the end of our Life, but may be ſometime before our dying day; but <hi>we know not what time that is,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is raſhneſs, for any Soul to conclude my time is paſt. Where have we any Directions from the Word of God to fix any ſuch time, or to conclude it as to any period of time? We know the Maſter of the Vineyard called to ſome to come and Work in his Vineyard at the 11th. hour, and we know alſo that the Thief upon the Croſs was told in the laſt hour of his Life, that he ſhould that Night be with Chriſt in Paradiſe. Secret things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto God, Revealed things onely to us and to our Children. Unleſs we had ſome certain Rule to determine the Time to us, we have no Reaſon to determine it our ſelves, to diſcourage us from what
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:62919:119"/> his Word commandeth us as our certain Duty.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, <hi>Suppoſing there be an heart found in us to be ſorry for our Sins, humbled for them, and to turn from them to God, and to accept of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and his Salvation tendred unto us in the Goſpel;</hi> it is <hi>certain our time is not yet paſt:</hi> The Reaſon is, becauſe the promiſe of Pardon and Salvation is made unto ſuch. So that no Soul hath reaſon to conclude there is no hope for him in God; but that Soul that laboureth under impenitency, and hardneſs of heart, and findeth in it ſelf a reſolution yet to go on in its ſinful courſes: And therefore you ſhall obſerve in that dreadful Text, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. the Apoſtle ſaith of them that have been once enlightened, and have taſted of the heavenly Gift, and the Powers of the World to come, and have been made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if they fall away, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>they ſhould be renewed again by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;</hi> if they could Repent, it were not impoſſible <hi>they ſhould be Pardoned</hi> or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Eternal Life and Salvation;</hi> but it pleaſeth not God to renew them by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: if thou findeſt an heart to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, to bleed for Sin and turn from it, there is no Reaſon for thee to Deſpair,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:62919:120"/> or to conclude it is too late for thee It is a true ſaying, That <hi>True Repentance. is never too late;</hi> for it always hath the Promiſe of Pardon and Forgiveneſs annext.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Fourthly, as to that Text <hi>Heb. 10. 26. If we ſin wilfully after we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Knowledge of the Truth, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth no more Sacrifice for Sins. It is not to be underſtood ſtrictly as the words ſeem to ſound,</hi> as if it concerned all Perſons that ſin againſt their <hi>Light and Knowledge,</hi> but onely of <hi>ſome degrees of wilful ſinning;</hi> for all the Sons and Daughters of Men would be in a ſad ſtate, if there were no Sacrifice for ſin remaining for any, that after the receiving and owning of the Truth, did in any degrees knowingly and wilfully ſin againſt God: But this alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ext, and the Text, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. to which this is apparently pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralel; 1. It ſpeaketh of <hi>Adverſaries</hi> v. 27. 2. <hi>Of ſuch as trod under foot the Son of God, and counted the Blood of the Covenant, with which he was ſanctified, an unholy thing.</hi> It is apparent he ſpake of Chriſtians <hi>that made a total open Defection from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel to Judaiſm.</hi> This is that which v. 26. He called the <hi>forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the aſſembling themſelves together; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:62919:120"/> the Communion of all Chriſtians;</hi> and a malicious contempt and deſpiſing of Chriſt, and of his Blood; counting it an unholy thing. <hi>The Truth</hi> which he here ſpeaketh of, is undoubtedly <hi>the Truth which he had before opened in this Epiſtle;</hi> wherein he had enlarged in a Diſcourſe to prove, that Chriſt was <hi>truly God,</hi> and <hi>truly Man,</hi> and the true <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhadowed out by the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh High Prieſt.</hi> Now ſaith he, if a man <hi>ſin wilfully,</hi> that is, having owned and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged and profeſſed this Truth, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards reject it, deny it, apoſtatiſe from the profeſſion of it, leaving the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of Chriſtians, ſhall joyn himſelf to the Aſſemblies of thoſe who are the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries of Chriſt, and continue and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly go on in that apoſtacy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: What ever Remedy he may dream of finding in the <hi>Jewiſh Sacrifices,</hi> he will indeed find that there is none of their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices will do him good, nor will Chriſt expiate for him; ſo there will be no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for his Sin.

               <p n="1">1.

Indeed it is poſſible all this may be, and yet a Soul recovered out of theſe ſad Circumſtances, may again return with the Dog to its vomit and the Swine to the wallowing in the mire again; but this is not what at preſent thou canſt conclude, to hinder thy Souls Hope and Confidence in the Mercy and Free-grace of God.</p>

This is the firſt thing.</p>
               <p>2. A Second thing which I would offer to ſuch a Souls Reflection, is <hi>the greatneſs of the Sin of Deſpair. Preſumption</hi> is a Sin, but yet <hi>Deſpair</hi> ſeemeth to be a far greater Sin: To Evidence which, I ſhall deſire you to conſider, 1. <hi>What it Implieth.</hi> 2.

               <p n="1">1.

Can God give Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance? Can God give me Faith in Jeſus Chriſt? What is this, but to limit the Almighty? The unbelieving Noble Man,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:62919:124"/> of whom you read in the Book of <hi>Kings,</hi> when the Prophet fore-told that Food ſhould by the next day be at ſo cheap a Rate; ſaid, <hi>If God would make Windows in Heaven, the thing could not be:</hi> The Prophet told him <hi>it ſhould be, he ſhould ſee it, but he ſhould not Eat of it;</hi> and the Chapter telleth you he ſaw it verified, he ſaw it the next day, but he was <hi>trodden to Death</hi> by the Multitude. <hi>Sarah laughed</hi> (it was a laughter of unbelief) when the Angel told her ſhe ſhould have a Son: God puniſhed it gently in her, but more ſeverely in <hi>Zachary,</hi> that would not believe that his barren Wife ſhould have a Son; <hi>he was ſtruck Dumb:</hi> What doeſt thou do leſs than Queſtion the Power of God? If God can forgive Sins, why mayeſt thou not hope? If he can, even in the laſt hour give Repentance unto Life; why ſhould a living Man not hope? Ah! but ſaith this Soul, No, no, I do not doubt but God can do it, but he will not do it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, Is not this to deny the <hi>Lords Goodneſs and Mercy?</hi> God hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted his Mercy above all his Name; when God proclaimed his Name to Moſes, <hi>Exo.</hi> 34. you ſhall find there 8 or 9 Expreſſions, all but one <hi>(which will by no</hi>

De Dieu ad Loc.)</hi> doubt whether we have tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Tranſlated that Phraſe:) God triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth more in this than in any other part of his Name; he hath choſen to be exalted in his Arttribute of Mercy, he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted it above all his Name: Now this is that Artribute, the Glory of which <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair</hi> Robbeth God of. <hi>Preſumption</hi> deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him the honour of his <hi>Truth,</hi> of his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>Judgment,</hi> which indeed he ſtileth his <hi>Work,</hi> but his <hi>ſtrange Work,</hi> as that which floweth not from himſelf; but is as it were forced from him by a meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Cauſe in the Creature. <hi>Mercy</hi> is the proper and natural Work of God, <hi>flowing meerly from himſelf without any Cauſe in the Creature.</hi> This is that, the Honour of which Deſpair denieth unto God, nor is it to be freed from a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning the Power of God alſo; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though (as thou pretendeſt) thou doeſt not Univerſally queſtion the <hi>Prerogative and Power of God to Forgive Sins,</hi> yet thou denieſt his Power <hi>to Forgive thy Sins,</hi> yea the Sins of any who are in the like Circumſtances of ſinning with thee: for unleſs thou canſt charge him (with whom
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:62919:125"/> there is no reſpect of Perſons, with a particular Malice, or Ill Will to thee) in ſaying God cannot, nor will not, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don thy Sins; or there is no hope for thee: thou denieſt not onely the Power of God as to the Pardon of thy Sins, but the Sins alſo of any other whoſe Circumſtances of ſinning are as great as thine are: Now ſeemeth it to thee a light thing, O Chriſtian, to deny the Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to ſet Limits to Infinite Mercy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This Sin always carries with it alſo <hi>A denial of Gods Truth, and Faithfulneſs.</hi> He hath told thee, <hi>Mat. 12. 31. That all Sin and Blaſphemy, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with any ſhall Blaſpheme the Son of Man, ſhall be Forgiven: That if thy Sins were as Scarlet, they ſhall be as Wooll; if as Crimſon, they ſhall be as White as Snow:</hi> No, ſayeſt thou, I have Sinned, I have Blaſphemed, and it ſhall not be Forgiven: I have <hi>Scarlet Sins,</hi> and God will not make them as <hi>Snow.</hi> I have <hi>Crimſon Sins,</hi> and God will not make them as <hi>Wooll.</hi> What is this, but to put the lie upon God, to deny his Truth and Faithfulneſs, to ſay he hath ſaid it, and he will not do it; he hath ſpoken it, but it ſhall not come to paſs? But ſome will ſay it to me <hi>after this rate of Arguing, God ſhould ſave all Men</hi>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:62919:126"/> 
                  <hi>and Women breathing:</hi> Theſe words are nomore ſpoken to me than to any other. I Anſwer, I do not urge theſe great and precious Revelations of the Divine Will, as grounds for Sinners to conclude that they <hi>ſhall be Saved,</hi> Pardoned, and Saved, without any more a-do; but onely as <hi>general grounds of Hope</hi> that there may perhaps be Mercy found with God for us; and as Aſſurances on the part of a gracious God, that if we miſs of Pardon, and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life</hi> and <hi>Salvation,</hi> the fault ſhall not be juſtly charged on God, he is ready to forgive; but in our ſelves, who will not Repent, nor leave our Sins and turn unto God; who will not come unto Chriſt that we might have Life; ſtill it remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the duty of us that would obtain this Pardon, to confeſs its Sins and forſake them, and to believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: but the <hi>Deſpairing Soul</hi> throws all the blame of its miſcarriage upon God, and ordinarily, doth not ſay, <hi>I do not Repent, I cannot Repent;</hi> therefore there is no hope, but there is no Mercy in God: God cannot, or God will not Pardon me now, I ſay. This is an Impeachment, <hi>as of the Power of God,</hi> to forgive to the utmoſt, and of Chriſt to ſave to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, ſo of that Goodneſs, and Grace,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:62919:126"/> and Mercy of God, yea, and of the <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Faithfulneſs of God.</hi> Beſides, <hi>What a Compariſon doth the Soul make here,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>finite</hi> and <hi>infinite;</hi> betwixt which two there is no proportion: Let thy Sins be what they will or can, they can be but finite, <hi>The Mercies of God are infinite.</hi> The Sea is but a <hi>finite Creature,</hi> yet what can you imagine ſo great that the Sea will not ſwallow up and cover, that it ſhall not be ſeen any more. It is a Similitude which God himſelf doth ſometimes make uſe of, by it to expreſs the plenty of his <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving Mercy.</hi> See that excellent Text, <hi>Micah 7. 18, 19. Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth Iniquity, and paſſeth by the Tranſgreſſion of the Remnant of his He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage; he retaineth not his Anger for ever, becauſe he delighteth in Mercy: He will turn again, he will have Compaſſion upon us, he will ſubdue our Iniquities, and thou wilt caſt all their Sins into the depths of the Sea.</hi> Now Deſpairing Concluſions, <hi>That there is no Hope in God, that our Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities are too many, or too great, to be forgiven;</hi> give God the Lie as to this. It is no more than the Scripture ſaith, 1 <hi>John 5. 10. He that believeth not God, maketh God a Liar, becauſe he believeth not the Record that God gave of his Son;</hi>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:62919:127"/> 
                  <hi>and this is the Record, that God hath given to us Eternal Life; and this Life is in his Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Secondly, This Sin, as it implieth theſe things, ſo it is always attended with <hi>Unbelief in Gods Promiſes,</hi> and with very hard and unworthy Thoughts of God. By <hi>Unbelief,</hi> here I underſtand, <hi>the Negation of a Truſt and Confidence in God,</hi> and the Promiſes he hath made of thoſe good things concerning which the Soul <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaireth.</hi> So that what ever can be ſaid in aggravation of the Sin of <hi>Unbelief,</hi> is highly applicable in the aggravation of this Sin; for <hi>Deſpair</hi> ſpeaketh the higheſt degree of <hi>Unbelief</hi> imaginable. It is one thing for a Soul <hi>not to truſt in God,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to conclude, <hi>That he is not to be truſted in as to my Soul,</hi> that there is no hope for me in God. This ſpeaketh the higheſt degree of Unbelief that we can imagine.</p>
               <p>2. Beſides, it neceſſarily carrieth along with it, very <hi>hard and unworthy Thoughts of God.</hi> The Soul cannot think reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently and worthily of God, when it is rooted in ſuch Thoughts as theſe, that although he be a God that Pardoneth Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, Tranſgreſſions and Sins, yea, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly Pardoneth, yet he will ſhew it
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:62919:127"/> no Favour, but adjudge it to an Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miſery and Torment; nay, it is hard to conceive how ſuch a Soul ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear wiſhing that <hi>there were no God, that the Being of God were annihilated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Then in the laſt place, The <hi>Effects of this Sin of Deſpair,</hi> muſt needs be very ſad; for as a <hi>Lively Hope</hi> of obtaining a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Good, <hi>quickeneth the Soul</hi> to the uſe of all thoſe Means which Reaſon dictateth, as probable Means for the obtaining what we deſire; ſo the Deſpair of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any ſuch Good, quite <hi>deadneth the Heart,</hi> and taketh it off all Thoughts of <hi>uſing Means</hi> to obtain that which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth with it ſelf impoſſible to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. This is manifeſt upon the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of all ſuch Souls as at any time are under any <hi>Fits of Deſpair:</hi> They cannot be perſwaded to hear <hi>Sermons,</hi> to <hi>Pray,</hi> to <hi>Read;</hi> in ſhort, not to uſe any Means of Grace and Salvation. So that a greater Sin can hardly be imagined than this Sin of Deſpair is. Oh that thoſe would think of this, who find in their Souls any Motions, Temptations, or Inclinations towards it. That they would think how much Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour God hath from this Sin above others.</p>
               <p>3. Again, Certainly it muſt be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:62919:128"/> to ſuch a Soul, to <hi>reflect upon thoſe great Preſidents</hi> of Free Grace, which we have upon Record in Holy Writ. Let them remember the inſtance of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſaith of himſelf, That <hi>he was a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor,</hi> he was a <hi>Blaſphemer</hi> and <hi>Injurious,</hi> but yet he obtained Mercy; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. The inſtance of <hi>David</hi> reſtored <hi>again to the joy of Gods Salvation,</hi> after the guilt of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery</hi> and <hi>Murther.</hi> Of <hi>Peter,</hi> who received kind Looks from Chriſt, after he had thrice denied his Maſter, and that with the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Curſing</hi> and <hi>Swearing,</hi> that he did not know him. Of <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> out of whom the Lord had caſt out Seven De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils. Let ſuch a Soul think of theſe great inſtances, and of thoſe who <hi>Crucified the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, Acts</hi> 2. 36, 37, 38. yet at <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon were <hi>pricked at the Heart,</hi> encouraged by the great Apoſtle to <hi>Repent</hi> and be <hi>Baptized,</hi> in the <hi>Name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the Remiſſion of their Sins;</hi> and had the Promiſe of <hi>receiving the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>

               <p>4. O let no ſuch Soul neglect the <hi>Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> or <hi>Hearing of the Word of God,</hi> that is the Proximate Object of our <hi>Hope.</hi> God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the primary and proper Object, none can give Remiſſion of Sin or Eternal Life but God; but by the <hi>Word,</hi> and from the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:62919:128"/> Revelation of the good will of God in his Word, we come to Hope in God. I look therefore upon that as a great Conqueſt, which the Devil hath gotten over a Soul <hi>Deſpairing,</hi> when he hath perſwaded it not to hear, not to read the Word; that is indeed to omit the Means by which its Darkneſs ſhould be diſpelled, and a true and lively Hope ſhould be begotten in it.</p>
               <p>5. To all theſe ſhould be added <hi>Faſting</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> the <hi>Efficacy of which depends</hi> on this, That it is Gods Work to <hi>beget the Soul to a lively Hope,</hi> through the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 3. It is true, a Soul in theſe Fits is not very fit for Prayer; how ſhall it <hi>Pray in Faith?</hi> But yet I would not have it wholly to neglect Prayer. But let it call in the Help of godly Miniſters and Chriſtians; let it ſend for the <hi>Elders of the Church,</hi> and <hi>let them pray for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. I ſhould have added before, I ſhall now cloſe this Diſcourſe with it, <hi>Let ſuch a Soul be often whetting upon it ſelf, and let others be ſuggeſting to it, the moſt liberal Promiſes of Free Grace and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and the greateſt Preſidents of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving Mercy,</hi> which the Scripture af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth. And let there be frequent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:62919:129"/> of them upon and to the Soul; poſſibly though at the firſt or ſecond of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, they may not ſtick to the Soul, nor the Soul take any Comfort from them, yet at laſt they may. But ſo much ſhall ſerve to have ſpoken to this <hi>Black</hi> and exceeding Dangerous <hi>Temptation.</hi>

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:62919:132"/> yet there was a Generation <hi>that</hi> were mad of their Luſts, and yet not willing to think they ſhould be Curſed in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and undone, therefore promiſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that though they walked according to their own Luſts and Imaginations, and went boldly on in Courſes of Sin, yet they ſhould have <hi>Peace, Outward Peace, Inward Peace, Eternal Peace.</hi> So there are a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of People ſtill that do the like, as to whom the Lord ſaith, <hi>He will not ſpare them,</hi> but make them eminent inſtances of his <hi>Wrath</hi> and <hi>Vengeance.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>I Have heretofore told you, That every Motion to Sin (come it from whom it will, and in what degree it will) is a
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:62919:134"/> 
                  <hi>Temptation,</hi> tho according to our common way of ſpeaking, we onely call ſuch motions <hi>Temptations</hi> when they are <hi>Violent</hi> and <hi>Impetuous.</hi> Now in regard we may be moved to Sin, from the <hi>Devil,</hi> or from the <hi>World,</hi> or from our own <hi>Luſts;</hi> there are three Principal <hi>Tempters</hi> againſt whom the <hi>good Fight</hi> is to be managed. <hi>The World, The Fleſh,</hi> and the <hi>Devil.</hi> As to this particular Temptation, it may be from all three, or any of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Such a <hi>Temptation may be, and often is from the Devil;</hi> he is the <hi>Deſtroyer,</hi> and he goeth about like a <hi>roaring Lyon, ſeeking whom he may devour:</hi> He <hi>Tempts</hi> to <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical and Blaſphemous Thoughts,</hi> to <hi>Self-Murther,</hi> to <hi>Deſpair;</hi> but theſe are his <hi>Back-Game,</hi> which he ſeldome or never playeth with the Soul until he ſeeth his Fore-Game loſt. So long as he can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade a Soul to go on in a courſe of Sin, and yet flatter it ſelf with <hi>Peace and Hope of its Salvation,</hi> or confidence as to it, he will never perſwade it to <hi>Deſpair</hi> or <hi>Self-Murther;</hi> the other <hi>Temptation</hi> doth his buſineſs with far leſs noiſe, and the effect of it will be every whit as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, if not more: Who would fight his Enemy if he can kill him with a <hi>ſleeping Potion?</hi> Now if you ask me how the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:62919:135"/> worketh here? I Anſwer either more <hi>Immediately</hi> or more <hi>Mediately.</hi> More <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, by Impreſſing Notions in our Minds, which believed, will raiſe up ſuch confidences in us: Mediately, making uſe of others to ſuggeſt ſuch Notions to us</hi> and to perſwade us to imbrace them. If once the Devil can Imprint ſuch Notions upon our Souls as theſe, <hi>That God will ſave all his Creatures, or all theſe that are Baptized,</hi> or all that <hi>are abſolved and take the Sacrament when they die,</hi> &amp;c. or an hundred ſuch like; and either by the force of his <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,</hi> or by the <hi>Swaſions</hi> and Suggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of others, induce Men to believe them, he hath done his Work.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such a <hi>Temptation</hi> may be from our own <hi>Luſt: Luſt</hi> in the general notion of it, is nothing elſe but <hi>inordinate deſire,</hi> whether it be the <hi>deſire</hi> of a thing which God hath <hi>forbidden</hi> us (ſuch was <hi>Eves</hi> deſire of the <hi>forbiden Fruit)</hi> or an <hi>unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful irregular deſire</hi> of ſomething which under <hi>due Circumſtances</hi> or in a <hi>lawful manner</hi> we might have our <hi>Appetite</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out after. The <hi>Peace and Quiet of our Spirits</hi> is a <hi>good thing,</hi> and the true object of a good Chriſtians deſire; but when a Man or Woman deſires <hi>to obtain it any way and by any means,</hi> this is <hi>Luſt.</hi>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:62919:135"/> Now by this <hi>Luſt</hi> Men are <hi>tempted</hi> and <hi>enticed</hi> to <hi>Preſumption,</hi> to hatch up a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, a groundleſs confidence in their Hearts, <hi>that they are in Favour with God, and when they die, ſhall go to Heaven;</hi> &amp;c. tho they have no juſt ground for any ſuch hope or confidence: Every Man Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally wiſheth well to himſelf, and hath no inclination to prophecy evil unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: <hi>No Man loves to live under a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant awe and fear of ſuch</hi> a thing as having his portion for ever in a Lake, <hi>burning with Fire and Brimſtone,</hi> and from his eager deſire to be free from ſuch a Torment conjoyned. 2. <hi>With a deſire not to deny himſelf in ſenſual ſatisfactions,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth this Temptation to lay hold upon any thing that may give him any colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able pretence to hope for a better Portion; and thus this Temptation may be from our <hi>Lust,</hi> as St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>Every Man is tempted, when he is drawn away by his own Luſt and enticed.</hi> The poor Sinner hath a deſire to <hi>wallow in his Luſts</hi> and to enjoy himſelf in the gratifying of his Senſes, and withal he hath no <hi>deſire</hi> to be in the middeſt of his <hi>Cupps frighted</hi> as <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> with a <hi>Mene, Mene;</hi> nor trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the ſowre reflections of a Guilty and Condemning Conſcience: Hence he

Now it may be worth an enquiry, what falſe <hi>Notion:</hi>
                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:62919:139"/> thoſe are, upon which Men build up theſe <hi>Preſumptions,</hi> and which the <hi>Devil,</hi> the World, or our own <hi>Luſts,</hi> ſuggeſt and build upon, as upon a ſandy Foundation. I ſhall name ſome, and onely in this place ſhew you, that if theſe Notions were true, they might give a foundation for ſuch Confidences (at leaſt ſome of them, others not) I ſhall reſerve my demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the falſhood of them, until I come to the Applicatory part of my Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That God will not Eternally Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn any Man or Woman that he hath made, eſpecially not any within the boſome of the Church:</hi> This hath not been the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed Opinion of many who have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed their Sentiments to the World; <hi>We Read</hi> of <hi>Huberus</hi> and <hi>Paccius</hi> and ſome two or three more, who have adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to publiſh ſuch Sentiments to the World, but by the lives of too many it is proclaimed; that there are too many ſuch <hi>Atheiſts</hi> in the World; for they wallow in ſuch prodigious Filthineſs as it is impoſſible but that they muſt conclude, that if there be an <hi>Hell;</hi> and it be not to ſtand empty, they are like to goe to it; for none can live more prodigiouſly lewd and profane lives than they do. Now
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:62919:140"/> indeed if this Notion were true, if Men could but perſwade themſelves that they are <hi>Gods Creatures,</hi> it were enough for them to be confident of Gods Favour and their going at laſt to Heaven.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Second Notion which ſome have taken up, is <hi>That Chriſt hath dyed for all,</hi> and all <hi>thoſe for whom he dyed ſhall be Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> The latter part of this, is held by no learned Man that I know (though if I could admit the former; I ſhould not be very difficult as to the latter.) There are (as I have formerly told you) three Opinions concerning <hi>Redemption,</hi> as to the Objects of it: <hi>Some ſaying he died equally for all,</hi> as much for <hi>Judas</hi> as <hi>Peter:</hi> (Thus ſay the <hi>Arminians)</hi> others that he died for all, but <hi>not equally:</hi> He pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed a <hi>certainty of Salvation for ſome a poſſibility for all.</hi> (Thus the <hi>Methe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſts,</hi> or thoſe that are for the middle way.) <hi>Others ſay he died for no more than the Elect.</hi> I intend not to meddle with this great Queſtion; onely I ſay, no ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious and learned Man, that hath held either of the two firſt <hi>Opinions,</hi> hath ſaid, or will ſay, <hi>That all thoſe for whom Chriſt died, ſhall be Saved.</hi> All agree in the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of that; but I fear, abundance of leſs judicious People are of that Mind,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:62919:140"/> and here build up their Preſumptuous Hopes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Third Notion is, <hi>That Sin is waſhed away in Baptiſm.</hi> There are ſome learned and great Men indeed, who have thought, that the <hi>Guilt of</hi> Adams <hi>Sin,</hi> yea all <hi>Original Sin, is waſhed away in Baptiſm,</hi> and Men <hi>Juſtified</hi> in it; but they add, <hi>If by Actual Sins they put not a barr,</hi> ſo as all the Relief that Opinion affords (if it be true) as to Perſons <hi>dying in their Infancy,</hi> as to whom they are as gentle, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> was judged an <hi>hard Father;</hi> but I ſhall not enlarge on this, for there can be no other Pretence for this as to <hi>grown Perſons,</hi> than their <hi>Admiſſion into the Catholick Church by that Ordinance,</hi> and ſo it in part falleth in with the firſt Notion I named.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A Fourth <hi>Notion</hi> is, That <hi>Men and Women have their lives in their own hands, a Power in themſelves to believe and do whatſoever God hath required of them in order to their Salvation;</hi> ſo as they ſhall not need look after their Salvation, till they come within ſight of the Grave: Upon this they build up <hi>Preſumptuous Hopes</hi> all their Life, hoping to have time before their Death to bethink themſelves, and to turn unto God.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="262" facs="tcp:62919:141"/>5. Under a fifth Head may come Mens falſe Notions of <hi>Faith, Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Holineſs.</hi> They are told by <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that Faith is nothing elſe, <hi>but an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the propoſition of the Word</hi> (and that they think they do.) That <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> is nothing elſe, but <hi>ſome ſorrow for Sin,</hi> and <hi>a turning from ſome flagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Courſes unto God:</hi> That <hi>Holineſs is nothing</hi> but a <hi>performance of ſome good Works Commanded in Gods Word,</hi> or a <hi>Reſolution to do them,</hi> if they have time; ſo as if they do upon their Death-bed <hi>profeſs they die</hi> in <hi>the Faith,</hi> and <hi>declare they are ſorry for their miſpent Life;</hi> and their <hi>Reſolution,</hi> if God ſpare their lives, to live a better Life: This is enough to carry them to Heaven.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A Sixth is this, <hi>That if they do but receive the Sacrament, and receive Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution from a Miniſter before they Die:</hi> This is enough to ſecure their Eternal <hi>Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> For <hi>whoſe Sins they Remitt are</hi> Remitted.</p>
               <p n="7">7. A Seventh is (and that is perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Popiſh) That if they happen to die under the Guilt of Sin (if it be not one of the ſeven Mortal Sins, and that without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance) it is but lying ſome years in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,</hi> and <hi>they ſhall come out and go to</hi>

                  <hi>Heaven;</hi> nor would thoſe Teachers of <hi>Preſumption</hi> put that neceſſity upon them, if it were not to get money for <hi>Maſſes to be ſaid for their Souls,</hi> or to get <hi>Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> for them, to help them out of the <hi>Imaginary Fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are ſome of thoſe Notions, which drank in, and imbraced by any, are the grounds of this <hi>Preſumption,</hi> as to which I am now Diſcourſing.</p>
               <p>The onely Queſtion remaining, is what Chriſtians ſhould do to avoid daſhing upon this deſperate Rock.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>What to be done by Chriſtians, to avoid daſhing upon this Rock of Preſumption. The firſt means to poſſeſs our ſelves of the falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of thoſe Notious upon which theſe Preſumptions are bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed. Three of them inſtanced in ſeveral Arguments, to prove That Gods Creation of us,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:62919:142"/> Chriſts dying for all, And the Efficacy of Baptiſme, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, without any thing more ſufficient grounds, for any upon which to hope for Pardon of Sins, or Eternal Life and Salvation.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. THe firſt thing to be done, is for <hi>Chriſtians to poſſeſs themſelves of the falſhood of thoſe Notions, which are the foundations upon which their Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Hopes are raiſed, and the Truths of God in oppoſition to them;</hi> and here ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me to run over all the <hi>Notions,</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inſtanced in; and to ſhew you the egregious Vanity of them. I begin with the firſt of them, <hi>That God will damn none of the Sons and Daughters of Men which he hath made.</hi> This I perſwade my ſelf, is in the heart of a great many more than will ſpeak it out; let me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhew you the exceeding folly and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it in ſome particulars:</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the firſt place, if I could ſay no more, yet this were ſufficient, <hi>That there is no ſuch Revelation of the Will of God, in any line of Scripture.</hi> Where hath God ſaid, any where in Scripture, <hi>The</hi>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:62919:142"/> 
                  <hi>he will ſave all Men?</hi> Now the ſtrength of this lies here, That <hi>Eternal Life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Gift,</hi> a free Gift <hi>of God</hi> and Chriſts, that to which none is born, <hi>Rom. 6. 23. John 17. 2.</hi> given by Chriſt to thoſe <hi>whom the Father hath given him;</hi> not to all, but to thoſe <hi>whom the Father hath given him:</hi> it is the higheſt folly imaginable, for any to <hi>hope</hi> God will <hi>give it him,</hi> who is under no Circumſtances, ſuch as God hath ſaid, he will give this great Gift to thoſe that are under. You would think that Man mad, that ſhould nouriſh an hope that you would give him your Eſtate, when you never told him, or any one elſe, that you would give him a Groat; and why are you then ſo ſecure for your Souls, whoſe Intereſt is ſo infinitly more valuable? Why ſhould you think that God favoureth you, and will ſave you, when he never told you ſo, either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly or explicitly? Do you truſt to the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Graciouſneſs of the Divine Nature?</hi> Or to <hi>his Relation, to you, as you are Gods Creatures,</hi> he your Creator? You may as reaſonably think that all the Devils in Hell ſhould be ſaved Why ſhould not the Goodneſs of Gods Nature, as well extend to them, as you? They
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:62919:143"/> are your elder Brethren, the firſt of the Creation; more excellent Beings by Creation, than Man was: Where is your confidence then, <hi>becauſe God made you;</hi> if you can neither conclude it, from the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> nor from your <hi>Relation to God,</hi> as he is your Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, nor from any letter of his <hi>Reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Will:</hi> Whence can you lay the ſtreſs of your Souls upon this, <hi>That God will ſave all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Yet ſomething might be hoped from hence, with more Reaſon; <hi>If God had not expreſly Revealed his Will to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</hi> Surely you would think that Man, or Woman, much worſe than mad, that ſhould hope you would leave him, or her, your whole Eſtate, when you ſhall have ſaid, and ſworn, that you would not give him a Groat. There is no clearer piece of the <hi>Revealed Will of God</hi> in Scripture, than that ſome of the Sons and Daughters of Men <hi>ſhall periſh Eternally;</hi> Dan. 12. 2. Thoſe <hi>that ſleep in the duſt ſhall awake, ſome to Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life, and ſome to Everlaſting Shame and Contempt.</hi> There ſhall be ſome to whom Chriſt will ſay, <hi>Depart from me, I know you not, you workers of Iniquity;</hi> Math. 7. 23, 24. Some to whom he will
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:62919:143"/> ſay, <hi>Depart from me you Curſed, into Everlaſting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels,</hi> Matth. 25. 41. Some <hi>fooliſh Virgins againſt whom</hi> the <hi>Gates</hi> of Heaven <hi>will be ſhut;</hi> v. 10. Some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom he will come in <hi>Flaming Fire to take Vengance, who ſhall be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with everlaſting Deſtruction;</hi> 2 Theſſ. 1. 9. Some that <hi>ſhall never enter into the Kingdom of God;</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 9, 10. ſome that ſhall have their portion in the Lake, <hi>that burns with Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone; Rev. 21. 8. Iſa.</hi> 27. 11. Yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, God made theſe Perſons: He did not make them to damn them, but by their Impenitency and Unbelief, they damn themſelves. As he did not <hi>make them to damn them,</hi> ſo he did not make all with an <hi>Intention</hi> or <hi>Reſolution to ſave them;</hi> let them live how they pleaſed: Now for us to build up hopes upon a fooliſh Notion, expreſly contrary to the <hi>Reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Will</hi> of God, is a moſt unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Folly.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If God would ſave all thoſe that he hath made, <hi>To what purpoſe thinkeſt thou, hath he given out a Law to direct Mens Converſations; fortifying it with Promiſes not onely of good things in this Life, but of another Life, and with threatnings</hi>
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:62919:144"/> 
                  <hi>not onely of Miſery in this Life, but of Eternal Miſery in the Life to come, to thoſe that Preſumptuouſly violate it?</hi> The truth is, this is a principle that none can poſſibly entertain, unleſs he be turned <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> and believes no Scriptures, no <hi>Hell</hi> at all: For was Hell prepared for none thinkeſt thou? Settle thy ſelf therefore upon this, That <hi>God will moſt certainly turn into Hell, ſome, and thoſe not a few, of thoſe Men and Women which he hath made.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. A <hi>Second</hi> falſe Notion that ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume upon, is the <hi>Redemption purchaſed by Chriſt.</hi> Chriſt they ſay hath died for <hi>All,</hi> and by the term <hi>All,</hi> they underſtand <hi>every Man and Woman.</hi> Now to avoid this Rock, I ſhall offer theſe few things to a Chriſtians ſerious Conſideration:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That although it be true in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-phraſe and way of Speaking, that Chriſt died for All, and for the World; yet the Scripture no where ſaith, that Chriſt died for every Man:</hi> And the term <hi>All</hi> doth very ordinarily ſignifie <hi>Many,</hi> or <hi>All</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>ſuch and ſuch Circumſtances,</hi> of ſuch or ſuch a kind. It is ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 5. that <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and all <hi>Judea,</hi> and <hi>all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion round about</hi> Jordan, <hi>went out to</hi> John, that is, <hi>very many, or ſome of all ſorts;</hi> for none can imagine that every Man, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:62919:144"/> and Child, went out. There is but one Text that foundeth like a Proof that Chriſt died for <hi>every Man;</hi> it is that, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 9. where we tranſlate it; <hi>That he by the Grace of God ſhould taſte Death for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man;</hi> but it muſt be reſtrained by the next verſe, where he ſpeaks of <hi>many Sons being brought to Glory,</hi> and therefore he, the Captain of their Salvation, was made perfect <hi>through Sufferings.</hi> And in the <hi>Greek</hi> there is no more than <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, for <hi>every;</hi> the Subſtantive is either <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and then the ſenſe is, he taſted of <hi>every Death,</hi> or (which it may be is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable) it muſt be ſupplied from the next verſe, for <hi>every Son who was to be brought unto Glory.</hi> But not to enter into that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, onely to caution you from laying too great ſtreſs upon Particles in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider (what I before hinted) <hi>That none of thoſe who hold the utmoſt Extenſion of the Death of Chriſt, as to the Objects, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaid, That all thoſe for whom Chriſt died ſhould be ſaved.</hi> Thoſe indeed who believe Chriſt died only for the Elect, aſſert this; but thoſe who hold Chriſt died <hi>equally</hi> for all, no more for <hi>Judas</hi> than for <hi>Peter;</hi> and thoſe that ſay Chriſt by his Death pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed a certainty of Salvation for ſome,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:62919:145"/> and a <hi>poſſibility of Salvation</hi> for all, yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them will ſay, <hi>That all ſhall be ſaved for whom Chriſt died;</hi> which hath made me often admire at Mens heats for theſe Opinions, which if they could prove to be true, have no more Significancy. Indeed they ſeem to be calculated for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but the <hi>Aſſertion of a Power in the will of Man, to chuſe and do what God requireth, in order to Salvation,</hi> and ſo to be his own Saviour. Now if this be all that any underſtanding Man pretends to in his aſſerting that <hi>Chriſt died for all,</hi> how is it poſſible that any particular Soul can from his Belief of it, conclude <hi>he ſhall be ſaved?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Beſides, this Notion is preſſed with the <hi>ſame abſurdities,</hi> as that which I firſt mentioned; for he that believeth, <hi>That Chriſt died for all and every Man,</hi> and therefore <hi>for him,</hi> muſt needs hold <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Salvation,</hi> though not upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Creation,</hi> yet upon the account of <hi>Chriſts Redemption;</hi> and this is not onely to hold, what God no where hath revealed in his Word, but that which is directly contrary to the <hi>Revelation of the Word;</hi> and that which is contrary to a <hi>multitude of Promiſes</hi> and <hi>Threatnings;</hi> and will make them to be meerly <hi>ſuperfluous</hi> and
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:62919:145"/> 
                  <hi>inſignificant.</hi> The concluſion is, That thou haſt no ground from any ſuch <hi>Notion</hi> (be it true or falſe) to conclude any ſuch thing, as that thou art <hi>actually reconciled to God, and ſhall be ſaved;</hi> nor did ever any judicious Perſon ſo conclude: but I fear thouſands of ignorant ordinary Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons build their Hopes here, and my ſelf have by ſome been told ſo.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third Notion upon which ſome may be <hi>tempted</hi> to preſume, is, The <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> and <hi>Efficacy</hi> of <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> The Jews, you know, reſted much upon their <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion;</hi> and I fear too many amongſt Chriſtians, reſt as much upon their <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> and their being in it <hi>Regenerated and Born again.</hi> To arm you againſt this Temptation, I ſhall, as to the other, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you ſome few things to be conſidered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>None can be confident upon this account, but they muſt conſider Baptiſm, either as it is the Door into the Church.</hi> From thence it muſt follow, <hi>That all thoſe that are Members of the Church of God ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Or Secondly, As an <hi>Ordinance of God, with which God doth conſtantly concur,</hi> in <hi>waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away the guilt of Sin by Vertue of the Blood of Chriſt.</hi> I ſhall ſhortly ſhew you that which of theſe two ways ſoever Men look upon their <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> they can make no ſuch <hi>concluſion</hi> from it.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:62919:146"/>1. There is nothing in Scripture to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie ſuch a Conceit, <hi>That all thoſe who are by Baptiſm admitted, into the Catholick viſible Church ſhall be ſaved;</hi> for I pray obſerve in this Notion of Baptiſm,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It doth no more than <hi>Circumciſion did under the Old Teſtament, to which it ſucceeded.</hi> Circumciſion was the Door into the Church of the Jews, as <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is the Door into the Goſpel Church. Now there is nothing clearer in all the Scripture, than that all thoſe that were Circumciſed were not ſaved. <hi>Judas</hi> was Circumciſed, yet a <hi>Devil,</hi> a <hi>Son of Perdition.</hi> The <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſes, Lawyers</hi> and <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,</hi> againſt whom our Saviour (in the Goſpel) denounced ſo many <hi>Woes,</hi> they were all <hi>Circumciſed.</hi> The Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly tells us, that <hi>Circumciſion availeth nothing, nor yet Uncircumciſion, but a New Creature. That Circumciſion verily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth Perſons, if they keep the Law, but if they were Breakers of the Law; their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion is made Uncircumciſion;</hi> Rom. 2. 25. <hi>That he is not a Jew, which is one out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, neither is that Circumciſion which is outward in the Fleſh; but he is a Jew which is one inwardly, and Circumciſion is that of the Heart and the Spirit, and not in the Letter; whoſe Praiſe is of God, not</hi>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:62919:146"/> 
                  <hi>of Men; v. 28. 29.</hi> What is more plain than that of our Saviour, <hi>Publicans and Harlots ſhall enter into the Kingdom of God, and the Children of the Kingdom ſhall be caſt out; Luke</hi> 13. 26, 27, 28. v. 25. he is ſpeaking to the Jews, who were all <hi>circumciſed,</hi> all Members of the onely Church, God (at that day) had in the World; <hi>When once the Maſter of the Houſe is riſen up, and hath ſhut the Door, and you begin to ſtand without, and to knock at the Door, ſaying, Lord, Lord, open unto us, and he ſhall anſwer unto them, I know you not whence you are<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>: Then ſhall you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſay, We have Eaten and Drank in thy Name, and thou haſt taught in our Streets.</hi> I hope all theſe were Sons of the Church, and no ordinary Members of it, but v. 27. <hi>He ſhall ſay I know you not whence you are, depart from me all ye workers of Iniquity; there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth; when you ſhall ſee</hi> Abraham <hi>and</hi> Iſaac; <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>and all the Prophets, in the Kingdom of God, and you your ſelves thruſt out. And they ſhall come from the Eaſt, and the Weſt, and the North, and the South, and ſhall ſit down in the Kingdom of God. And behold there are laſt which ſhall be firſt, and firſt which ſhall be laſt.</hi> So as this alone
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:62919:147"/> is no ground of Hope or Confidence to any Soul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This appeareth further from hence, <hi>That many Perſons be Baptized, and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Churches, in whom Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, which the Word of God every where makes neceſſary to Salvation, are moſt certainly wanting.</hi> Many Perſons are Members of the Church by Baptiſm, who yet are <hi>Drunkards, Whoremongers, Lyars, Unbelievers;</hi> ſuch as the Scripture hath expreſly ſaid ſhall <hi>have their Portion in the Lake which burneth with Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone. Baptiſm</hi> therefore in this Notion affordeth not the leaſt ground of Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to any thinking and conſiderate Soul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Suppoſe we take <hi>Baptiſm</hi> in the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Notion,</hi> as it is an <hi>Ordinance of God, inſtituted for ſomething.</hi> It is true, the <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> what it is, and how far it extendeth, hath been a great Queſtion amongſt Divines: Some aſcribing to it the <hi>Juſtification of the Soul, and the Remiſſion of Sins to all;</hi> but then they reſtrain it to <hi>Original Sin,</hi> and ſo it onely (as I before ſaid) gives us Comfort as to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren dying in their Infancy; others main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <hi>The Regeneration of Elect Infants by Baptiſm.</hi> I ſhall freely tell you what I judge is all in this Cauſe.</p>
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:62919:147"/>
               <p>The moſt of thoſe <hi>Baptized,</hi> in the time of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> were Perſons grown up, who had firſt made a viſible Profeſſion of their <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> to theſe <hi>Baptiſm</hi> was a <hi>Seal of the Forgiveneſs of Sins,</hi> and an <hi>Engagement</hi> to an <hi>Holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation;</hi> as you read, <hi>Rom. 6. 4; &amp;c.</hi> To Infants it is a Seal of the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> as exhibited to Mankind. That in caſe they do <hi>Repent</hi> and <hi>Believe,</hi> their Sins ſhall be waſhed away with the Blood of Chriſt. To theſe it is <hi>an Ordinance of Admiſſion</hi> into the Church. To theſe it is an <hi>Engagement to be the Lords;</hi> an <hi>Avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God for their God, and Chriſt for their Saviour.</hi> To theſe, if when they grow up, they ſhall <hi>Repent and Believe,</hi> it ſhall be as a <hi>Fountain of Living Water, ſpringing up in the Soul to Eternal Life;</hi> they ſhall (as the Apoſtle inſtructeth the <hi>Romans) Rom.</hi> 6. 4, 5, 6. fetch Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, obliging them to <hi>die unto Sin and to live unto God.</hi> Whether it hath any ſuch <hi>immediate Effect,</hi> as to <hi>all,</hi> to <hi>juſtifie them from the guilt of Original Sin,</hi> or <hi>to Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate them,</hi> that is, to make a change in their Heart, I ſhall not diſpute, but cannot prove it, nor do underſtand how poſſibly it ſhould have any further effect of this Nature, than <hi>Circumciſion</hi> had to
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:62919:148"/> the Jews: I am ſure the Holy Scripture makes Pardon of Sin and Juſtification, not the neceſſary or ordinary Effect of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, but of <hi>Confeſſion of Sin, True Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> and <hi>forſaking of Sin,</hi> and <hi>True Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving</hi> in the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Flatter not your ſelves therefore, if there be any Soul that liveth in any known courſe of Sin, that never confeſſed his Sins and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook them, nor knew what godly Sorrow for Sin meant, nor what it was to receive the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to believe in him; onely knoweth he was <hi>Baptized,</hi> and he <hi>liveth in the Church,</hi> and is called a Chriſtian, and here he reſteth, not doubting, but being confident that he ſhall be ſaved. Let me tell him or her, he <hi>preſumeth,</hi> and truſts his Soul upon a Lie; and that which no weighed Divine, of any Perſwaſion, would ever ſay was a ſufficient bottom to reſt his Soul upon.

               <head>CHAP. V.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>The Notion of a Power in Man to Repent and Believe, agreed by few, if true, no ground of hopes for Eternal Life. Why Miſtakes about the Nature of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Converſion, Saving Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Faith, Holineſs, great Occaſions of Preſumption. The Truth as to thoſe Notions en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired and proved. What Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, Repentance, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, Faith, Holineſs, is neceſſary to Salvation, and to the raiſing any Hopes in us with Relation to it.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>4. A <hi>Fourth Notion</hi> which I inſtanced in as a cauſe of Preſumption, was this, <hi>That every Man and Woman hath his Life in his hands,</hi> I mean a <hi>power in and of himſelf</hi> (ſuppoſing the Common Grace of God denied to none) <hi>to do all that</hi>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:62919:149"/> 
                  <hi>God requireth of him in order to Salvation,</hi> is a power to <hi>Repent,</hi> to <hi>Believe,</hi> to <hi>Love God,</hi> &amp;c. Hence many think that there is <hi>no haſte</hi> for Men to <hi>deny themſelves,</hi> or to <hi>take up the Croſs,</hi> or to <hi>follow Chriſt;</hi> they may ſtay till <hi>they are old,</hi> and their Eyes can be no longer pleaſed with <hi>Seeing,</hi> nor their <hi>Ears</hi> with <hi>Hearing;</hi> if then <hi>they do but Repent and Believe,</hi> all is well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. As to which give me leave to ſpeak two or three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As brisk as this Opinion ſeemeth to be in the World, I could never yet meet with any ſo hardy as to affirm, <hi>That theſe things were within the Power of Man, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Aſſiſtance of Special Grace.</hi> I have met with many that have talked high for the <hi>Power of Mans Will,</hi> but when they have been brought to a cloſe Diſcourſe, they would aſſert it no farther than either as to <hi>Moral Actions,</hi> or Acts of <hi>Moral Diſcipline.</hi> They would affirm indeed, that a Man hath a power to <hi>go to Church,</hi> inſtead of going to the Tavern, to turn away his Foot from the <hi>Houſe of an Harlot,</hi> to do <hi>Juſtly,</hi> and an hundred ſuch things: to <hi>read,</hi> to <hi>hear the Word,</hi> to <hi>pray,</hi> to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider his Sins.</hi> Now theſe are things which none denieth, onely we ſay, his power as to theſe is much weakened by the fall. So
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:62919:149"/> as we doubt whether by <hi>Common Grace,</hi> and all the <hi>Natural Power</hi> Man hath, he can do theſe materially good Actions, when he is preſſed with a <hi>vehement Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation:</hi> But I ſay I could never yet meet with any that would ſay, It is in the <hi>power of Man</hi> to <hi>Believe,</hi> to <hi>Repent ſavingly,</hi> to <hi>Love God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If any doth ſay ſo, <hi>He ſaith what is contradicted by a multitude of Scriptures.</hi> But it is not my work to enlarge here on that Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the next place, Thoſe Divines that do hold the greateſt Natural Power in the Will of Man, yet do ſay, <hi>Time may be paſt,</hi> that a Man may have ſinned away this Natural Power, and have his Heart ſo hardened in a Courſe of Sinning, that he may have loſt this Power, and ſo be concluded to an <hi>Eternal Miſery,</hi> which alone (to conſiderate Souls) is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſpoil its Preſumption from this Head. For how ſhall I, who go on in a Courſe of Sin, knowingly <hi>preſume,</hi> becauſe I have a power in my ſelf to turn when I will, if it be poſſible, that I may by a Courſe of Sinning have ſo provoked God, as he may have given me up to a judicial blindneſs of Mind and hardneſs of Heart.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Admitting thou haſt <hi>ſuch a Power,</hi>
                  <pb n="280" facs="tcp:62919:150"/> if it ſtill remaineth eſtabliſhed, that this Power muſt be produced into <hi>Act;</hi> and that before thou canſt enter into Heaven, thou muſt actually <hi>Repent and Believe; how doſt thou know thou ſhalt have time for it?</hi> May not God take away thy Soul with a ſtroke? May he not come upon thee on the ſudden, and ſay, <hi>This Night thy Soul ſhall be taken from thee;</hi> and then what doth thy Power ſignifie? Doeſt thou not ſee Men and Women die ſuddenly? So that a pretence of ſuch a Power in thee ſignifies nothing, but that thou art more inexcuſable by it, if indeed thou hadſt ſuch a Power, that thou didſt not uſe it for the end for which thou hadſt it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I proceed now to the great grounds of Mens Preſumption, <hi>viz. Miſtakes as to the</hi> Nature of <hi>Regeneration, Faith,</hi> and <hi>Holineſs.</hi> The Scripture makes all theſe ſo neceſſary to Salvation, that altho ſome ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Perſons may build up to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, idle and preſumptuous Hopes; becauſe <hi>God made them,</hi> and Chriſt died for all Men, and they are <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Baptized;</hi> &amp;c. yet conſiderate Perſons plainly muſt ſee, <hi>That unleſs a Man be born again, of Water and the Spirit, he can never enter into the Kingdom of God;</hi>
                  <pb n="281" facs="tcp:62919:150"/> they are the indiſputable words of our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 3. 3. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaith that, <hi>Neither Circumciſion avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any thing, nor uncircumciſion, but a new Creature:</hi> Our Saviour ſaith: <hi>He that believeth not, is condemned already, he ſhall never ſee Life, &amp;c.</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>without Faith and Holineſs, no Man ſhall ſee the Lord:</hi> No conſidering Man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can poſſibly raiſe up to himſelf any hopes of the Pardon of Sin, or Eternal Life, but he muſt ſatisfy himſelf, that he is <hi>Regenerated;</hi> that he doth <hi>Believe;</hi> and that he doth <hi>ſo far Obey, as God will accept it.</hi> To this purpoſe nothing can ſerve the Devils turn ſo effectually, as for the Soul to be deceived in the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Faith and Holineſs:</hi> Nothing can be more the concernment of the Soul, than to take care it be not deceived. There have been ſeveral Notions of <hi>Faith</hi> that have ſtriven for <hi>Maſtery</hi> in the World.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is the <hi>Popiſh Notion,</hi> who make Faith to be the <hi>Souls Aſſent</hi> to the <hi>Propoſition of the Word,</hi> which may be without any <hi>Practical Obedience;</hi> for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a Man aſſenteth to the truth of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, which yet he alloweth not an influence upon his Life; and indeed this is ſuch a <hi>Faith,</hi> as the Apoſtle tells us,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:62919:151"/> the <hi>Devils</hi> are poſſeſſed of, <hi>They Believe and Tremble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Second is their Notion, who make <hi>Juſtifying Faith</hi> to be what our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour tells us it is, <hi>John 1. 12. A Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, a cloſing, an hearty cloſing with him as offered in the Goſpel, hoping, truſting in him, and him alone for Salvation.</hi> No Soul can poſſibly do this, that doth not firſt Aſſent to the <hi>Propoſition of the Goſpel,</hi> and agree to what that Revealeth concerning Chriſt; both as to his Perſon, and as to his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to Save: But it is poſſible that a Soul may <hi>Aſſent to thoſe Propoſitions,</hi> and yet not <hi>Receive Chriſt</hi> upon the Terms he propoundeth. This Receiving Chriſt and Truſting in him as their Saviour, they ſay neceſſarily draws on <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> (though <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> are two things) for the rational Nature of Man will not ſuffer him to hope or truſt in another for any kindneſs, which he hath promiſed upon Terms, without the fulfilling of thoſe Terms upon which it is promiſed; but this they ſay may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <hi>certain Aſſurance</hi> of the Souls Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, which a man cannot have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he be Juſtified.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Third, is the Notion of them <hi>who</hi>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:62919:151"/> 
                  <hi>make it a full Aſſurance</hi> of the <hi>Love of God;</hi> but <hi>yet ſuch a one as obligeth the Soul to all manner of Duty:</hi> and this ſeems to have been the Notion of ſome <hi>Eminent Divines</hi> upon our firſt <hi>Reformation,</hi> but is rejected by latter Divines, as it being not poſſible that that ſhould be an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument</hi> in our <hi>Juſtification,</hi> which it is not poſſible that any Soul ſhould have till it be <hi>Juſtified:</hi> beſides that many a Pious Devout Soul hath not arrived at this.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Others make it to be a confident <hi>Perſwaſion, that Chriſt died for them;</hi> whether they find themſelves obliged to Live to him yea or no.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Others make it to be a <hi>Practical Aſſent</hi> to the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The danger of a Souls <hi>Preſuming,</hi> is from the firſt and the fourth of theſe principally. If Men and Women think they do <hi>Believe becauſe they do agree to the Propoſition of the Goſpel,</hi> they may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly run away with a vain Imagination, that all the Promiſes of the Goſpel are their Portion, when indeed not one of them belongs to them; becauſe this <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving is not that Believing which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures make neceſſary to Salvation:</hi> for the evidence of which, ſuffer me to offer
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:62919:152"/> theſe few things to your Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe this <hi>Aſſent</hi> may be <hi>without any Holineſs or Conformity to the Will of God:</hi> Murtherers, Traytors, Thieves do agree to the Propoſition of Humane Laws, though they prodigiouſly violate them. There may be an Aſſent of the Underſtanding to a Propoſition, to which Mens Luſts and Paſſions ſuffer them not to live up to; but we know that <hi>without Holineſs none can ſee God,</hi> and therefore this cannot be <hi>that Believing</hi> to which the Promiſes of <hi>ſeeing God</hi> and <hi>living with him</hi> are annexed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe as I ſaid before, <hi>the Devils thus Believe;</hi> yea I believe better than the moſt of Men do. For our Aſſent to a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine according to the workings of our Reaſonable Natures, is more or leſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Evidence of it. Now the Devils have ſeen the Propoſitions of the Goſpel, <hi>That Chriſt is the Eternal Son of God: That he was made Man, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for our Sins.</hi> Theſe are Propoſitions, which the <hi>Devils</hi> having been in the World ever ſince the Creation, muſt needs ſee in a <hi>better Light</hi> than any Man can do, who onely ſeeth the truth of them by the light of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> or the <hi>Revelation of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:62919:152"/> not imprinted upon his Soul by the <hi>Demonſtration of the Spirit,</hi> Revealing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to the Soul what is generally Revealed in the Word.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly Conſider, That every where in Scripture, <hi>A Perſon,</hi> the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt, is made the object of that Faith; to which the Promiſes of Life are made:</hi> It is made a believing <hi>in Chriſt; on his Name,</hi> a <hi>Receiving of him, a come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him.</hi> Now a <hi>Propoſition,</hi> not a <hi>Perſon,</hi> is the object of <hi>Aſſent:</hi> We indeed ſometimes ſay, We <hi>Aſſent to ſuch, or ſuch a Perſon;</hi> But the meaning is, we <hi>agree to ſuch a Propoſition,</hi> which he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by word of Mouth, or by Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The Object of Juſtifying Faith, the Scripture makes to be the Perſon of the Mediator: I therefore begg of you, to take heed that you deceive not your Souls, by this Notion of <hi>Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And take as much heed of their wild <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> who make <hi>Faith to be nothing elſe</hi> but an <hi>aſſumed confidence that Chriſt died for them,</hi> let them live as they liſt. This ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parateth <hi>Faith and Holineſs,</hi> without <hi>which no man ſhall ſee the Lord;</hi> and is indeed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better in it ſelf, than a moſt bold and unwarrantable preſumption, excluſive of that <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>trembling</hi> with which we are
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:62919:153"/> commanded to <hi>work out our Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their Notion is far better, who make Faith to be a <hi>practical Aſſent,</hi> but ſtill (I pray obſerve) the <hi>Act of the Soul,</hi> is made to be <hi>Aſſent,</hi> and the <hi>Object of Aſſent</hi> can be no other than a <hi>Propoſition,</hi> and for my own part, I cannot think this the <hi>Act</hi> of that <hi>Faith</hi> that <hi>Juſtifieth;</hi> for the Object of that Act as I ſaid before, is in Scripture conſtantly made the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator himſelf,</hi> not a meer Propoſition: I am afraid of this Notion, as calculated to juſtle Chriſt out of the place of a <hi>Mediator,</hi> wherein God hath ſet him; which was not onely to treat with his Father about the Terms of Mans Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but to ſtand as the <hi>middle Perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Man, to merit Salvation for us, by his Active and Paſſive Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by a gracious Act of God to be reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to us, upon our Acceptance of him, and truſting the Weight of our Souls upon him;</hi> which cannot be without our <hi>Aſſent</hi> to the <hi>Propoſitions of the Word:</hi> for upon the Credit of that onely it is, that the Soul applies it ſelf to Chriſt, and goes to him and receiveth him: Nor can it poſſibly be without <hi>practicial Holineſs,</hi> and a <hi>Regard to all Gods Commandments,</hi> and a ſincere indeavour to obſerve them;
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:62919:153"/> for as I ſaid before, he muſt talk like a mad-man, that ſhould pretend to hope in, or truſt to another, for a great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, which that other hath promiſed, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch or ſuch Conditions, whileſt in the mean time, he neither doth nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to perform thoſe Conditions; and let him talk what he will, he cannot heartily and truly hope for ſuch benefits: But yet <hi>Believing</hi> is not a <hi>meer Aſſent,</hi> nor is it <hi>practicial Holineſs,</hi> but a <hi>cloſing with</hi> and <hi>receiving</hi> of Chriſt as the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator</hi> and <hi>Saviour</hi> of Man upon the Terms of his Revealed Will. And I do very much fear that he who hopeth for <hi>Pardon of Sin, or Eternal Liſe</hi> and <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> without <hi>this believing, will never ſee the Face of God.</hi>

That alone is <hi>ſaving</hi> Faith, that alone is <hi>Regeneration, Repentance unto Life, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,</hi> which the Scripture makes ſo.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Law of God doth not onely reſpect the outward, but the inward Man, Jer. 31. 33. Pſal. 51. 6. Pſal. 5. 9. Math. 5. Ro.</hi> 2. 29.

               <p n="3">3. <hi>That the performance or forbearance of theſe things commanded in the Law of God, is not Holineſs, unleſs it be out of a Principle of Love</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> to God: A man may do what God hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and yet not eying the Command of God, be carried out to it from other <hi>Motives.</hi> Now this is no <hi>Obedience,</hi> no keeping of the Commandements of God.</p>

But leſs than this is no better than <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption</hi> from falſe Notions, taken up of <hi>Regeneration, Converſion, Repentance, Saving Faith,</hi> and <hi>True Holineſs.</hi> Yet further, <hi>In order to the avoiding of this Temptation, take heed of taking</hi> up <hi>ſcanty</hi> and <hi>narrow Notions</hi> of the <hi>Law of God.</hi> It is indeed a <hi>ſnare</hi> unto a <hi>Soul</hi> ſo to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the <hi>Divine Law,</hi> ſo as to <hi>doubt</hi> and <hi>fear</hi> Actions that are lawful, as if they were forbidden. But it is a more danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Rock for a Man to daſh upon, ſo to <hi>interpret Gods Law,</hi> as to make thoſe things lawful which <hi>God hath forbidden;</hi> or to undeeſtand thoſe things as <hi>unlawful,</hi> or at leaſt indifferent, which God hath commandeded; but I hinted it before to you and I now tell it you again. There is none that is but moderately acquainted with the Srriptnres, and with the Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the <hi>Popiſh Caſuiſts,</hi> but will plainly
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:62919:157"/> ſee that it hath been the great Deſign of their Divines for a long time, to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the Law of God ſo, as Men might <hi>keep their Luſts, and yet keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God, according to the ſenſe they have put upon them.</hi> In ſhort, <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Church,</hi> is almoſt with them <hi>The whole Duty of Man.</hi> There are ſome others that came too near them, making ſtrange looſe Interpretations of the Law of God. The precept for <hi>not taking Gods Name in vain,</hi> they ſay is onely to be underſtood againſt <hi>Perjury.</hi> The 4th. Commandement, onely commandeth <hi>the keeping ſuch days holy, as the Church ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points.</hi> Theſe and ſuch like Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſerve for nothing, but to help a Soul to <hi>preſume:</hi> And indeed this looſe Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the Law of God, is <hi>neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> to all ſuch, as maintain the <hi>Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Soul,</hi> not by the <hi>Righteouſneſs of Chriſt,</hi> but <hi>by a Righteouſneſs of our own: And that Man hath a Power in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> to do <hi>all that God requireth of him:</hi> I ſay it is neceſſary, for thoſe Men to interpret <hi>Gods Law, into a conſiſtancy with Mans Power:</hi> But let all good Chriſtians that value their Souls, take heed of thoſe <hi>Interpretations.</hi> Let them but Interpret the Commandements, ſo as by
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:62919:158"/> them ſhall be <hi>commanded</hi> and <hi>forbidden whatſoever is commanded and forbidden in the Word of God,</hi> and then they will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcern theſe fallacies; and ſo they muſt interpret them, or they cannot conclude, that the Ten Commandements contain the ſum of all that God hath commanded us to do and avoid; for it is moſt certain that the <hi>whole Scripture,</hi> is as much the <hi>Revealed Will of God</hi> as the <hi>Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and hath equal Authority with us. Be acquainted therefore with the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and call that <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> which that calleth ſo; and be aſſured that let Men tell you what they will, without that Holineſs, that <hi>Obedience, no Man ſhall ſee God.</hi> I have dwelt a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the longer upon this head, becauſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the great miſtakes of Men are upon theſe points, that Men fancy that their caſe is good, that they believe enough, and are holy enough to go to Heaven; nay to plead their Holineſs as a Righteouſneſs in which they ſhall adventure to appear before God.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A Sixth Notion which I inſtanced in of this miſchievous tendency: <hi>Is the</hi> Power <hi>of a Prieſt or Miniſter to give Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution:</hi> So as if while they live the Miniſter <hi>hath abſolved them,</hi> or if when they
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:62919:158"/> come to die, they can but <hi>Receive the Sacrement,</hi> be abſolved, they conclude their Caſe is good enough. The <hi>Opinion</hi> is in its <hi>Original perfectly Popiſh,</hi> but found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on that Text, <hi>Whoſe Sins ſoever you remit they are remitted, and whoſe Sins ſoever you retain, they are retained; John</hi> 20. 23. The words are ſpoken to Chriſts Diſciples, <hi>upon whom he breathed,</hi> v. 22. <hi>and ſaid, Receive you the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> then he adds, <hi>Whoſe Sins ſoever you remit, they are remitted, and whoſe Sins ſoever you retain, they are retained.</hi> And this Power, ſaith the <hi>Papiſt,</hi> every <hi>Prieſt</hi> hath, he deriveth from the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and hath the ſame Power given to him which Chriſt gave them: And there is a Tincture of this Doctrine, upon the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of ſome that are no profeſſed Papiſts; and I perſwade my ſelf, that many leſs knowing People peniciouſly reſt upon it: I ſhall therefore a little inlarge upon it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the firſt place. <hi>That God onely can forgive Sins, is a Principle ſo conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> to <hi>Reaſon;</hi> and <hi>ſo abundantly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in Holy Writ, that certainly none can make the leaſt doubt of it.</hi> Sin is a debt, a debt to the Juſtice of God; Chriſt hath taught us to pray with Reference to it: <hi>Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our</hi>
                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:62919:159"/> 
                  <hi>debtors.</hi> Now Reaſon tells us, that none can diſcharge a debt, but he onely to whom it is owing; it is an injury done to God, and who can forgive it, but the Perſon that hath received it: So that all the Queſtion can be, Whether <hi>God hath not commiſſionated Mininiſters to do it in his Name,</hi> and will not ratifie what they do.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>It is ſo great a Prerogative of God, ſo great a piece of his Glory, that it is a verry unreaſonable thing for any to think, that God ſhould truſt it out of his hands:</hi> Chriſt indeed (who thought it no Robbery to be <hi>Equal with the Father,</hi> and who had <hi>all Power in Heaven and Earth committed to him,</hi> had Authority on Earth to forgive Sins, but no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had ever ſuch a power: It is a piece of the Lords Name, <hi>I, even I, am he</hi> that <hi>blotteth out Tranſgreſſions for my Names ſake:</hi> It is his Glory, which <hi>he will not give unto another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, It cannot be imagined but that our Lord knew well enough, <hi>That if a Power of Forgiving Sins ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted to every Miniſter, many Mens Sins would be remitted expreſly contrary to the whole Tenour of the Goſpel.</hi> They know not who <hi>Believe,</hi> nor who <hi>truly Repent;</hi>
                  <pb n="299" facs="tcp:62919:159"/> they can judge but according to <hi>the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance.</hi> Now Thouſands may appear to us true Believers, and truly Penitent, that are not ſo; and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently many <hi>Unbelievers,</hi> many <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites and hard hearted Sinners,</hi> ſhould have their Sins remitted: Beſides Miniſters are no better then <hi>Elijah, Men ſubject to like paſſions with other Men;</hi> and out of <hi>Paſſion</hi> or <hi>Prejudice,</hi> might refuſe to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their Sins</hi> who <hi>did truly Believe</hi> and <hi>truly</hi> Repent; and can any Man think that our Lord ſhould commit ſuch a power to thoſe who are ſo <hi>Fallible,</hi> who are no competent Judges of Perſons whom God indeed will Pardon; but might through Ignorance, or through Paſſion and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, pronounce a <hi>Forgiveneſs</hi> of Sin, or a not <hi>Forgiveneſs,</hi> directly contrary to the Will of God? Or will any be ſo mad as to think that every Miniſter is Infallible? Or that God will in Heaven confirm what they do upon Earth, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to the Will of God? The <hi>Papiſts</hi> indeed contend the <hi>Pope is Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> but is every <hi>Prieſt ſo too?</hi> Or can they think that God will confirm his <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi> contrary to his own Revealed Will, as to thoſe Terms upon which alone he will forgive the Sins of any.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="300" facs="tcp:62919:160"/>4. It muſt therefore be underſtood one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a <hi>Declarative Forgiveneſs, Whoſe Sins ſoever you ſhall according to my Will declare Remitted, they ſhall be Remitted;</hi> and <hi>whoſe Sins ſoever you ſhall according to my Revealed Will declare not to be Forgiven, they ſhall not be Forgiven.</hi> Now this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration may be either <hi>General</hi> or <hi>Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar:</hi> Generally, every Miniſter that Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Goſpel, Declareth. <hi>That he who confeſſeth his Sins and forſaketh them, ſhall have Mercy:</hi> That he who <hi>Believeth ſhall be Saved</hi> more particularly. If any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian in any diſtreſs, ſhall ask the Judgment of any Miniſter, having declared the ſtate of his Soul to him, ſo as to give him a probable Hope, that he heartily hath repented, and doth truly believe; the Miniſter may <hi>Declare, If theſe things be true which thou haſt told me, if indeed thou truly repenteſt, and truly believeſt in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; God hath For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given thine Iniquities.</hi> But the truth of the latter, dependeth on the truth of the former, and it is impoſſible that any Miniſter ſhould have any other Power to <hi>Forgive any ones Sins, or Authority to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare them to be Forgiven;</hi> for he muſt not pronounce contrary to the Scripture: and therefore our <hi>Liturgy</hi> ſays no more,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:62919:160"/> 
                  <hi>Then that God hath given Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to his Miniſters, to declare Remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sins to thoſe that truly repent and believe his Holy Goſpel.</hi>

               <p n="5">5. The Apoſtles had, I cannot ſay <hi>any further Authority, but a further Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, for this, than ordinary Miniſters; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a more extraordinary Revelation, a more extraordinary ability to dicſern Spirits.</hi> Without doubt the Apoſtles themſelves were not authorized by Chriſt, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to any <hi>Impenitent,</hi> any <hi>Unbelieving Soul, that his or her Sins were forgiven;</hi> for this had been for our Lord to have contradicted himſelf. Indeed the Apoſtles might and did ſee further into Men than any can now do, by reaſon of the <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Gift of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it immediately is ſaid before, <hi>He breathed upon them,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Receive</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> I know none now to whom Chriſt ſo breatheth upon, and to whom he ſaith, <hi>Receive the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> yet as the <hi>Hebrew Docters</hi> ſay, <hi>Spiritus Sanctus non ſemper tangit corda Prophetarum:</hi> The Spirit of God did not always touch the the Hearts of the Prophets; the Prophets could not always Prophecy, but onely <hi>when the Spirit</hi> of <hi>Prophecy</hi> came upon them.

This being all can be affirmed of any <hi>Miniſters,</hi> with any <hi>Senſe</hi> or Modeſty, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> had no ground to Curſe all thoſe that held, <hi>That the Words of Chriſt, Whoſe Sins you remitt, are remitted; are to be underſtood of an Authority to Preach the Goſpel,</hi> or that <hi>the Prieſts Abſolution is not a Judicial but a Miniſterial Act.</hi> Yet this new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine paſſed not thoſe that were aſſembled in that <hi>Popiſh Council</hi> without Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Concil.</hi> Trid.

<pb n="303" facs="tcp:62919:161"/> Becauſe this Doctrine of the Prieſts or Miniſters <hi>Abſolution,</hi> ſavours much of the <hi>Popiſh Doctrine;</hi> I will a little ſhew you what their Doctrine is in the Caſe. 1. <hi>They hold</hi> that <hi>Original Sin</hi> is <hi>waſhed away in Baptiſm;</hi> then Children are regenerated and juſtified. 2. But in regard <hi>that after Baptiſme, Men ſin many times a day,</hi> they have therefore deviſed <hi>a Sacrament of Penance</hi> (as they call it) <hi>The matter of which they make to be Contrition, Confeſſion and Satisfaction;</hi> the Miniſter of it to be a <hi>Prieſt</hi> good or bad; for they determine that a Prieſt <hi>guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Mortal Sin, may adminiſter this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament;</hi> the vertue of which they ſay, doth not depend upon the quality of the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> but the <hi>Character of his Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Contrition,</hi> indeed, <hi>they make an hearty ſorrow for Sin: Confeſſion</hi> they ſay is not onely neceſſary in <hi>private to God,</hi> but in <hi>the Ears of the Prieſt;</hi> for, ſay they, <hi>how can he abſolve and remit Sins, if he doth not know them; and that in their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances:</hi> So that their Doctrine of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of <hi>Auricular Confeſſion</hi> (upon which account they all have their <hi>Confeſſors)</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon this Doctrine of the <hi>Prieſts Abſolution,</hi> all the pretended neceſſity of it is in order to the receiving that bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:62919:162"/> Then they further ſay, <hi>That God doth onely Pardon the Eternal guilt of Sin; and Chriſt hath onely ſatisfied for that: So that for the removal of Temporary Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, there muſt be alſo Satisfaction.</hi> Hence their Prieſts have power to appoint People <hi>Pilgrimages, Building of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, Paying ſums of Money for Satisfaction.</hi> This <hi>Penance</hi> being undergone, they do declare that any <hi>Prieſt</hi> (being appointed thereto by the Church) may in ordinary Cauſes, not onely <hi>Declaratively,</hi> but <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially, Pardon and Abſolve the Sinner:</hi> but if an higher <hi>Prieſt,</hi> a <hi>Biſhop, or the Pope, hath reſerved ſome Caſes in which he or they alone will have power to Abſolve, and to appoint to Penances and Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in thoſe, they onely can do it the more private, Prieſts cannot:</hi> This is their Doctrine. <hi>Proteſtants</hi> now ſay, that <hi>God alone can forgive Sins,</hi> but by his <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> in the Preaching of the Goſpel, he doth declare a Mans Sins are forgiven, who have a true <hi>Contrition,</hi> who <hi>truly repent, and believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> fully forgive them; ſo that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth no <hi>further Satisfaction</hi> for the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, than that which was long ſince gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the Blood of Chriſt, who hath <hi>Trod the Wine-preſs of his Fathers Wrath</hi>

                  <hi>alone,</hi> and finiſhed all that Work: They ſay indeed, that <hi>Confeſſion of Sins in moſt cauſes is ſufficient to God alone:</hi> It is he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone that can forgive them. In ſome Cauſes indeed a more open <hi>Confeſſion</hi> is neceſſary: 1. <hi>When the Church hath been publikely Scandilized,</hi> not that this is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in order <hi>to Gods Pardon,</hi> but as an <hi>Act of Obedience to Gods Will;</hi> and for a more <hi>Comfortable Brotherly Communion,</hi> and the Churches Satisfaction; that the Perſon ought not to be longer kept out of its Communion. 2. They ſay further, <hi>That in the caſe of great Horrors of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Terrors upon Peoples Spirits,</hi> it may be of great advantage to particular Chriſtians under ſuch Terrors, to <hi>confeſs ſome particular</hi> Sins unto their <hi>Judicious Brethren,</hi> or unto their <hi>Faithful Miniſters,</hi> but not in order to their <hi>Pardon of them,</hi> but in <hi>order to their Prayer to God for them, and offering words in ſeaſon unto them that are weary;</hi> and being more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and mighty in the Scriptures than they are, from the Scriptures, declaring the <hi>Will of God</hi> in their caſe, <hi>comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them,</hi> if their caſe will bear com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from the Word of God, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe adviſing them, what to do accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Will of God, that they may
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:62919:163"/> receive true and ſolid comfort and Peace.</p>
               <p>They do alſo further ſay, that <hi>Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction where any hath wronged another, is neceſſary, if in our Power,</hi> as in Caſes of <hi>Theft,</hi> &amp;c. but for any neceſſity of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> or <hi>Satisſaction,</hi> in order to <hi>Gods Forgiveneſs</hi> of the Sin; they do not underſtand it, nor believe it: And for <hi>Judicial Abſolution,</hi> they ſay it is <hi>Gods a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone Act,</hi> and that all that <hi>the Miniſter can do,</hi> is to declare <hi>the Will of God to</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in caſe they do truly Repent and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that <hi>God hath, doth, and will, forgive them</hi> freely for Chriſts ſake: In the mean time they do not deny but God may concurr with the Miniſter, as his <hi>Ordinance, giving a ſenſe of the Remiſſion of Sins,</hi> (which Remiſſion was before given them upon their Repentance and believing in Truth) to them, while the Miniſter faithfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth the Will of God, for the pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch as truly Repent and Believe; but if any perſon be <hi>Abſolved</hi> by a Miniſter, hath cheated him, and pretended Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and true Faith, having no ſuch thing his heart: Or if any Miniſter hath either through <hi>Ignorance</hi> or <hi>Paſſion,</hi> declared a Perſons <hi>Sins forgiven,</hi> whoſe Sins (while he is in thoſe Circumſtances) God hath
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:62919:163"/> ſaid he will not forgive, he may have cheated his own Soul, or the <hi>Miniſter</hi> may have cheated him, but <hi>God is not mockt,</hi> his ſins remain, notwithſtanding his pretended <hi>Abſolution.</hi> God diſpenſeth out the <hi>Grace of forgiveneſs,</hi> not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Ignorance</hi> and Paſſions of Men, but according to the Rules of Holy Scripture, which is the Revelation of his <hi>Divine Will.</hi> 2. Truſt not therefore to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch vain Imaginations, no nor to the <hi>Receiving of the Sacrament,</hi> either in thy <hi>life time</hi> or at <hi>thy death:</hi> That the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> is an Ordinance of God, by which God doth <hi>ſignify</hi> and ſeal the Remiſſion of Sins and Eternal Life, by the commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Chriſts death to ſuch as truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and believe, is out of queſtion, but that God in that Ordinance doth give <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sins,</hi> or hath appointed it, ſo <hi>ſignifie, ſeal, or convey,</hi> the pardon of Sin to any unbelieving Impenitent Soul, is a very great Errour. Such Perſons may <hi>Eat</hi> and <hi>Drink</hi> there, but it can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Condemnation.</hi> This hath made me frequently admire at ſome perſons fondneſs of that <hi>Holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, when they apprehend themſelves in danger of Death,</hi> who never made Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of it in the time of their <hi>Health</hi>
                  <pb n="308" facs="tcp:62919:164"/> and <hi>Life;</hi> eſpecially conſidering that it cannot be adminiſtred in a right order, <hi>viz.</hi> In the Communion of the Church, <hi>where many who are joyned in one body, eat of that one bread:</hi> Upon which all Proteſtant Churches reject private Adminiſtrations of that <hi>Inſtitution</hi> and upon juſt grounds. <hi>Chriſt firſt gave</hi> it to the 12, (at leaſt to 11 of them) we never read the Apoſtles Examples or Directions, to or of any ſuch Adminiſtrations upon this Account, unleſs ſome particular Perſons that have had long and <hi>lingring Sickneſſes,</hi> and of that nature as have not influenced their head, nor ſo indiſpoſed them, but their minds could at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the Action; ſome of which I have known deſiring a competent number of the Church with them, privately to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in the Ordinance, from the publick Participation of which they have been long hindred. I do not know that I ever knew any judicious Chriſtian ſo much as deſire ſuch an Adminiſtration, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others I have; which makes me think ſome more Ignorant People reſt upon it, and truſt to it: We know the Popiſh No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, and what a ſtir they make with the <hi>Hoſt,</hi> carrying it about in great ſtate to <hi>dying Perſons:</hi> And I fear a tang of their Doctrine, yet ſticks in the minds of
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:62919:164"/> many who are profeſſed Proteſtants. We know what a trade the Papiſt make of their Doctrines of <hi>Auricular Confeſſion; Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions, and Private Maſſes, Celebrated for the living and the dead:</hi> and were it not for the gain came into their Purſes by them, they could not be ſo fond of ſuch abſurd Opinions and Practices. But Chriſtians take heed of theſe Notions, which tend to nothing, but to nouriſh <hi>Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> in your Souls; and that you may take heed of them, let me mind you of 2 Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of our Saviours, <hi>Mark 4. 24.

The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of Notions upon the Mind is very great; our <hi>Hopes</hi> will be built upon the <hi>Notions</hi> which we receive: Takeheed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               <p>2. <hi>POſſeſs your Souls</hi> Secondly (if you would avoid this great Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) with the <hi>greatneſs of Sin, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Preſumption, and the great multitudes which ſplit eternally on this Rock.</hi> Here are three things offered to your Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The greatneſs of the Sin of Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> This will be underſtood partly by conſidering the <hi>Nature</hi> of it, partly by conſidering the <hi>Revelation of Gods wraih againſt it,</hi> as to the <hi>Nature of it. 1. It Robbeth God of the Glory of his Juſtice,</hi> it indeed ſeemeth to give God the honour of his <hi>Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> but it makes him an <hi>Idol of Mercy,</hi> and deſpoileth him of his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>Purity,</hi> and <hi>Holineſs:</hi> God indeed is <hi>Gracious and Merciful;</hi> but he is alſo a God of <hi>purer Eyes</hi> than to behold Iniquity: a God <hi>before whom</hi>
                  <pb n="313" facs="tcp:62919:166"/> 
                  <hi>Sinners ſhall not ſtand in Judgment;</hi> a God <hi>that cannot clear the Guilty.</hi> Now that Soul that goes on in its <hi>ſinful Courſes,</hi> and yet hopes to find <hi>Favour with God, and to go to Heaven</hi> at laſt, doth think that God is not ſo <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>pure a God</hi> as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he is, or that he is not ſo <hi>Juſt</hi> as he is; either that he hath not <hi>Power</hi> to be Revenged upon Sinners, or not ſo juſt a Will and ſteady a reſolution to be reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon ſuch as go on in their Courſes of Ungodlineſs, as indeed he hath. Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with they ſelf how great a ſin it muſt be, either to deny the <hi>Purity and Holineſs of God,</hi> or the <hi>Power and Juſtice of God:</hi> The Preſumptuous Sinner ſaith, God is not of ſo pure Eyes, but he can abide Iniquity; a Sinner may dwell in his ſight: whereas God could not be God if he could not be <hi>Juſt,</hi> or not be <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Pure:</hi> Holineſs is a piece of Gods Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he is not only <hi>Glorious</hi> in <hi>Majeſty,</hi> but he is alſo <hi>Glorious in Holineſs.</hi> 2. And as the <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Purity</hi> of God is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached by Preſumption, ſo his <hi>Truth is alſo Impeached:</hi> The Preſumptuous Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner doth in effect ſay, The <hi>Scripture</hi> is a <hi>Lie</hi> and a <hi>Romance:</hi> for the language of his heart is directly contrary to the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Scripture, that ſaith, ſuch
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:62919:167"/> and ſuch <hi>Sinners</hi> ſhall never enter into the Kingdom of God, but ſhall <hi>have their portion in the Lake which burneth with Fire and Brimſtone:</hi> He ſaith I am ſuch a one, yet I ſhall enter into the Kingdom of God, I ſhall not have my portion in the Lake which burneth with Fire and Brimſtone. What is this but either to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Scriptures to be the Word of God, or to deny that which is contained in them to be truth; and ſo to make God a liar; who is a God that cannot lie? Judge you how great an Iniquity this muſt be. And if the Impeachment of a Mans truth be counted ſuch a violation of his honour, that he knoweth not how to put it up, but is ready to revenge it with a Stab; what ſhall God do, who cannot lie? So that three eminent Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God, <hi>Purity, Juſtice, and Truth,</hi> are all of them <hi>queſtioned, impeached, or denyed,</hi> by the Preſumption of a Sinner. And <hi>Preſumption</hi> is not only a Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Law of God, but containeth in it a ſecret <hi>Impugning</hi> of the <hi>Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> and transformeth God into a being that is not <hi>Pure</hi> and <hi>Holy,</hi> at leaſt not ſo Pure and Holy, but it can abide <hi>Sin</hi> well enough, that either cannot or will not be revenged upon Sinners; that can declare one thing and do another.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="315" facs="tcp:62919:167"/>2. Secondly, <hi>The magnitude of any Sin is well taken and judged, from the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Divine Wrath againſt it.</hi> And it is but juſt and equal to judge that the greateſt Sin, againſt which God doth moſt ſeverely reveal his Wrath. As to this we ſhall need look no further then the Text, which I have made the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of this Diſcourſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. It is the Preſumptuous Sinner that is ſpoken of, <hi>v.</hi> 19. That <hi>heareth the</hi> words of <hi>the Law,</hi> and the <hi>words of the Curſe annexed</hi> to the violation of the Law, and yet <hi>bleſſeth himſelf in his heart, and ſaith, I ſhall have peace, though I walk in the Imagination of my Heart, and add drunkenneſs to thirſt.</hi> Now what ſhall the Righteous God do to ſuch a Man? <hi>v. 20. The Lord will not ſpare him, but then the Anger of the Lord and his Jealouſy ſhall ſmoke againſt that Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all the Curſes that are written in this Book ſhall be upon him; and the Lord ſhall blot out his name from under Heaven,</hi> v. 21. <hi>And the Lord ſhall ſeperate him to Evil out of all the Tribes of Iſrael, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all the Curſes of the Covenant that are written in this Book of the Law.</hi> What is poſſible to be added to that Commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? What can be more ſeverely ſpoken? So as if we may judge of the greatneſs of
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:62919:168"/> a Sin, by the greatneſs of the Curſes that are annexed to him that committeth it, we have all the reaſon imaginable to judge <hi>Preſumption</hi> one of the greateſt degrees of ſinning, by which it is poſſible that a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſhould provoke God.</p>
               <p>2. A Second thing which I offered to your conſideration was, <hi>the danger of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, as to theſe things; Preſumptions</hi> (as your reaſon will tell you in other things) are very dangerous in three Caſes; and ſuch all wiſe Men will take heed of.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Where the <hi>Good expected,</hi> or the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil we expect an immunity from, are of a very high and important Nature:</hi> A Man may venture to Preſume of a <hi>Victory</hi> in a Caſe at Law, where if he be overthrown he may loſe 40, 50, 100 <hi>l.</hi> in ſuch Caſes he will ſay <hi>he knows the worſt of it,</hi> if he be miſtaken it is but a money mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it is but the loſs of ſuch and ſuch a ſum of money; but a man will not do ſo where his <hi>life is in danger;</hi> he will there look for ſufficient grounds to hope he ſhall eſcape his <hi>Enemies charge:</hi> Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, the concern we are ſpeaking of, is not the concern of thy Eſtate, 'tis not the concern of thy <hi>Life,</hi> it is the concern of thy <hi>Body and Soul to all Eternity;</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes thee as thou art a Reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

This no Wiſe Man will do. It is true in our preſent caſe it is not ſo: While there is life there is hope, That man or Woman that hath hatched up preſumptuous hopes that he is in favour with God, that his Sins are pardoned, and he Eternally ſaved, may examine the grounds of his hopes; if he finds them inſufficient, he may acquit them, and uſe means to <hi>obtain a good hope through Grace.</hi> But <hi>dying preſumptions,</hi> they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate; for ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccleſ. 9. 10. <hi>There is no device, no work, no knowledge, nor wiſdom in the grave, whither we are going.</hi> Pſal. 49. 8. <hi>For the Redemption of</hi>

The Third Thing which I under this Head offered to <hi>your Conſideration,</hi> was the <hi>multitude of thoſe Souls</hi> that (ſo far as we can judge) <hi>ſplit upon this Rock.</hi> It is a great piece of Wiſdom to take warning by the harms of others. The Scripture tells us, that, <hi>Without Faith and Holineſs none ſhall ſee God.</hi> Heb. 12. 14. It telleth us 21. <hi>Rev. 8.

What did they die without hope? No they hoped to be Saved, and it may be died with Confidence they ſhould be Saved.

O dreadful! Is Eternity to be adventured in this Manner? Preſumption (Sirs) ſlayeth its <hi>Ten thouſands.</hi> Oh that it might not ſlay any Soul that heareth me this day.

<pb n="322" facs="tcp:62919:171"/> of getting to Heaven, and the ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe that ſhall be Saved.</hi> I ſay firſt the <hi>Difficulty of getting into Heaven.</hi> You have it confirmed to you from him who came from Heaven, from the Boſom of his Father, on purpoſe to reveal his Fathers Will in the Caſe; <hi>Matth. 7. 14. Strait is the Gate and narrow is the way that leadeth to Eternal Life, and few there be that find it.</hi> Oh what an eaſie thing do <hi>Papiſts</hi> make it to get to Heaven? What an eaſie thing do ſome others make it too? But whoever makes it eaſie, makes God a Lyar. Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>Strait is the Gate, and narrow is the way.</hi> If being <hi>Baptized, If Confeſſing Sins</hi> in the <hi>Ears of the Prieſt, and taking Abſolution from him,</hi> if living all your Life in Senſual Satifactions, then crying, <hi>Lord Receive my Soul,</hi> when you die, and Receiving the Sacrament, will bring men to Heaven, Oh what an eaſie thing it is to be Saved? But if a man muſt <hi>Believe in the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> if he muſt deny himſelf, and <hi>take up the Croſs</hi> and <hi>follow Chriſt,</hi> if he muſt <hi>keep under his body</hi> and <hi>bring it in ſubjection to his Spirit;</hi> and alſo bring his Spirit in ſubjection <hi>to the Will of God.</hi> If he muſt <hi>forget what is behind</hi> (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did) and preſs on <hi>to what is before, unto the price of the high Calling;</hi> if he muſt <hi>Watch</hi> and
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:62919:171"/> 
                  <hi>Pray,</hi> and <hi>Strive</hi> and <hi>Fight,</hi> and <hi>give all diligence to make his Calling and Election ſure,</hi> then Sirs it is no <hi>eaſie thing.</hi> Chriſt judged it no eaſie thing, St. <hi>Paul</hi> judged not ſo, and is it not ridiculous for any to think that God ſhould ſend his own Son to die an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed Death, to purchaſe atonement and reconciliation with God; that he ſhould <hi>ſweat drops of Blood</hi> and powre out his Blood on the Croſs, and be put to cry out, <hi>My God, My God, Why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this a Sinner living in the Church, and knowing and hearing of this, ſhould think it ſo eaſie a thing to get into favour with God, and obtain the Application of this Blood for the pardon of Sin, and ſo great a mercy as Eternal Life. Brethren let none deceive you, it is either no <hi>eaſy thing</hi> to get to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are not to be believed, nor Chriſt to be believed, that Chriſt in whom we alone hope for Salvation; thoſe <hi>Scriptures</hi> which we own as the <hi>Revelation of the Will of God</hi> to us concerning our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and all thoſe holy ſervants of God before us, who ſpent their time in <hi>Faſtings, Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Prayers, Mortifying</hi> their Members, and in all Examples of an Holy Life, and in the conſtant owning and profeſſion of the Truth unto death; were deceived and miſtak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, and lived and died as fools. Let men write
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:62919:172"/> and talk what they will, poſſeſs your Souls of the <hi>Difficulty</hi> of being Saved, you will find them to be at laſt in poſſeſſion of a great and uſeful Truth.</p>
               <p>2. Yea and Secondly, Poſſeſs your ſelves of the Truth of that which you have upon the ſame credit, <hi>That there are but few that ſhall be Saved;</hi> Matth. 7. 14. One pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that Queſtion to our Saviour, Luke 13. 23. <hi>Lord are there few that ſhall be ſaved?</hi> He replied unto them, v. 24. <hi>Strive to enter in at the Strait Gate, for many I ſay unto you will ſeck to enter in, and ſhall not be able.</hi> It is a Truth that there are but few will be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and he who obſerveth what conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Salvation the Scripture hath made, and conſidereth the lives of moſt, will ſee it muſt be true. But our Saviour in that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer teacheth us the true uſe we ought to make of that Notion: Not to conclude that <hi>we ſhall not.</hi> For who hath aſcended into Heaven, to bring us news from thence whoſe Names are or are not written in the Book of Life? Or who can tell who will repent and believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? 2. Not to <hi>deaden us to Duty;</hi> and make us ſay then it is in vain for us to do any thing, for <hi>we ſhall not be ſaved, do we what we will</hi> (no Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith ſo) but to quicken us, if we be in a ſtate of <hi>Ignorance, Unbelief</hi> and <hi>Impenitency,</hi>
                  <pb n="325" facs="tcp:62919:172"/> 
                  <hi>to Strive to enter in, to give diligence to make our Calling</hi> and <hi>Election ſure.</hi> For tho it be true, That in light matters that are of no great concernment, <hi>Difficulty</hi> diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageth indeavours, yet in things that we cannot be without and be happy, where our well being is highly concerned, <hi>Difficulties</hi> (eſpecially not appearing to us inſuperable) inſtead of deadening, quicken us to the uſe of utmoſt Indeavours. Live therefore in the daily view and apprehenſion of the Difficulty of getting to Heaven, and under the daily thoughts of what God hath revealed, That there are but few that ſhall be ſaved.</p>
               <p>4. Fourthly, <hi>Be frequent in the Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the grounds of your hope, and in the Examination have a care that your grounds have a Scripture Foundation;</hi> and that as to your <hi>Grounds from Holineſs, you conclude ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from your affections than your actions;</hi> and if at all from <hi>your actions,</hi> from the <hi>courſe of them,</hi> not <hi>from any ſingle acts; and lay more ſtreſs upon the Covenant of Grace, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of your ſouls unto it, than either up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your affections or actions.</hi> Here is a great deal put together in this one Direction, Let me ſhortly diſcourſe the ſeveral parts of it: 1. I ſay firſt be much in <hi>Examining the grounds of your hopes.</hi> Indeed I ſhould have firſt ſaid, <hi>Be much in whetting upon your Souls</hi>
                  <pb n="326" facs="tcp:62919:173"/> 
                  <hi>the belief of your Eternal Exiſtence:</hi> It is our want of belief of this, or attendance to the thoughts of this, which makes Men and Women ſo careleſs as to the looking after it: We had need have it rung in our Ears e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Morning and Evening, Sir, <hi>Remember you are going to Eternity.</hi> If Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men could be brought to that paſs, that like that Ancient we read of, where-ever they are, whatever they are doing, they ſhould think they hear the Sound of the <hi>Laſt Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet</hi> and the Voice, <hi>Ariſe you dead and come to Judgment,</hi> they would be oftner entring into and communing with their own Hearts about the Grounds and Reaſon of their Hopes to live with God in a Bleſſed Eternity, when they ſhall no longer live in the World. But O we do not think of Eternity, we do not believe Eternity ſo fixedly and ſteadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as we ſhould. God commanded under the Law by <hi>Moſes,</hi> Deut. 6. 6, 7. <hi>That the words which the Lord did command them, ſhould be in their hearts, that they ſhould diligently teath them to their Children, that they ſhould talk of them when they ſate in the houſe, and when they walked by the way, when they lay down, and when they roſe up; that they ſhould bind them as a ſign upon their hand, and they ſhould be as frontlets betwixt their eyes, and they ſhould be written upon their Poſts and upon</hi>
                  <pb n="327" facs="tcp:62919:173"/> 
                  <hi>their Gates.</hi> What God commanded as to his Law, I would have done as to every one of our <hi>Eternal State.</hi> I would have it written upon our Hearts, that <hi>we are going to Eternity,</hi> I would have you <hi>teach it to your Children,</hi> talk of it when you ſit by your <hi>Fire-ſides,</hi> when you go out, when you come in, when you lie down, when you riſe up. I would have, <hi>Remember Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> wrote upon the walls of your Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours and of your <hi>Bed-Chambers.</hi> I would have it always <hi>before your eyes;</hi> ſurely then your hearts would be often ſaying, <hi>To what Eternity am I going?</hi> Am I going to <hi>Eternnal Happineſs</hi> or to <hi>Eternal Torments?</hi> To the place where I ſhall <hi>Weep,</hi> and grieve, and vex no more, or to the place where will be nothing elſe, but <hi>Weeping,</hi> and <hi>Wailing, and gnaſhing of Teeth, and that for evermore?</hi> And you would not reſt in every ſlighty return your deceitful hearts ſhould make, flattering you with hopes of Heaven; but you would ſay, <hi>My Soul</hi> do not thou deceive me, upon what grounds doeſt thou tell me it ſhall be well with me for ever? We never think that we are ſure enough of a <hi>Debt</hi> or a <hi>little Eſtate;</hi> why ſhould we truſt in ſlighty ſeeming ſecurity for an Eternal Intereſt? And be aſſured of this, no grounds of Hope are
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:62919:174"/> worth any thing, but ſuch as <hi>plain Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture juſtifieth: Eternal Life is the Gift of God,</hi> the Scripture tells ſo, and we ſhould never have thought of Eternity but for the Revelation of it in Scripture; it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore given according to <hi>Scripture Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and no otherwiſe. It is given by Chriſt to thoſe that the <hi>Father hath given him,</hi> Joh. 17. 2. We cannot ſearch the Book of God to ſee the Names of thoſe the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath given him, but he hath told us who are given him; <hi>John 10. 27. My Sheep hear my voice, and follow me, and I give unto them Eternal Life, and they ſhall never periſh.</hi> Thou haſt no ground to hope for Eternal Life, but from thy <hi>bearing</hi> (hearing and obeying) the <hi>voice of Chriſt,</hi> and thy <hi>following of him;</hi> but ſo many are our failings, ſuch are our ſhort and imperfect walkings, that here a good Chriſtian may have his doubts and fears, whether he heareth Chriſts voice and ſo followeth him, that he may che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh hopes in himſelf, that he is one to whom Chriſt will give Eternal Life: To guide you therefore, I ſay,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Do not take up your hopes from ſingle Actions, but from a continued Courſe of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> The <hi>Philoſopher</hi> tells us, That <hi>ſingle</hi> Acts will never denominate a Man <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,</hi>
                  <pb n="329" facs="tcp:62919:174"/> nor yet <hi>Vicious:</hi> He is not a <hi>Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi> that is once overtaken with drink, but he that makes a trade of it; he is not a <hi>juſt Man</hi> that now and then doth a juſt Action, but he that in his whole Courſe giveth to every one his due; nor is he an <hi>holy Man,</hi> that ſometimes doth <hi>good Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Hears, Prayeth;</hi> but that Man that hath Regard to all Gods Commandements, and that at all times, in all Places, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There is none ſo good but doth ſome things ill (who liveth and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not?) Nor are there many to be found ſo bad, but do ſomthings good: <hi>Herod</hi> heard <hi>John the Baptiſt gladly, and he did many things,</hi> Mark 6. 20. That is the holy Man, that in the whole Courſe of his Life, applyeth himſelf to the Pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, enquiring what the good Will of God is, and ſetting himſelf to do it, and not turning aſide there-from, though by ſome <hi>Paſſions, Corruptions, Temptations,</hi> &amp;c. he may ſometimes be turned out of his way.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, Lay more ſtreſs upon your <hi>Affections than upon your Actions,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they muſt <hi>Juſtifie</hi> and <hi>Legitimate your Actions. Ends and Affections</hi> make up the <hi>form of Holineſs,</hi> and diſtinguiſh it from the good Works of the Heathens; which

                  <hi>Auguſtine</hi> rightly called <hi>Gay</hi> and <hi>Splendid Sinnings.</hi> The Law is, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart:</hi> Let a Man do what he will, if it be not out of love to God, out of a deſire to pleaſe him, and a fear to offend him, it is no holineſs, it is but <hi>Oſtentation,</hi> or <hi>Self-ſeeking,</hi> or meer <hi>Moral Vertue.</hi> Let a Man fail in his <hi>Action,</hi> whether through <hi>Infirmity,</hi> or <hi>Temptation,</hi> yet if his deſire hath been to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, if his Hearts Affections have been right, he is accepted of God; do not therefore in your <hi>Examination of this ground of your Hope,</hi> ſo much truſt to what you find you have done for God and in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Will, as from what <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> it hath been done, <hi>to what end,</hi> with what <hi>Affection, &amp;c.</hi> Say to your Souls, I have been an Hearer of Sermons, one that has uſed to Read, to Pray; but what hath been my Principle in it?

<pb n="333" facs="tcp:62919:176"/> Chriſtians hope then? but in this, <hi>The Lord hath made with the Son of his love an Everlaſting Covenant, well ordered and ſure in all things;</hi> a Covenant that in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> which he hath paid to his Fathers Juſtice, the price which he hath paid, his <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> ſhall be reckoned for <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> to every Soul, that upon the offer of the Goſpel ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, cloſe with him, accept him, and in ſincerity of Heart ſhall give up himſelf to the <hi>Obedience</hi> of his Will; for this is every good Mans <hi>Salvation:</hi> and when we have done all here, the ſtreſs of our <hi>Hopes</hi> muſt lie. Yet here is no <hi>ground for Hope</hi> without <hi>Action,</hi> true Affections towards God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined with ſincere Actions. The <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> will not relieve one ill principled and looſe walking Chriſtian, tho it be the onely relief for a <hi>Sincere Chriſtian,</hi> that is ſenſible of his <hi>imperfect walking</hi> with God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Fifthly, If you would take heed of <hi>Preſumption, you muſt take heed of wilful ſinning againſt Light;</hi> doing any thing which your Conſcience telleth you, you ought not to do. The Nature of Man is biaſſed to propheſie and promiſe good to himſelf; none but an <hi>Atheiſtical, Sleepy, Secure</hi> Soul, that never thinks of Heaven or Hell, or what ſhall become
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:62919:177"/> of him after this Life, but maintaineth ſome ſecret hopes in one degree or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he is in the Favour of God, that his ſins are Pardoned, and that he ſhall be Eternally Saved. Now theſe hopes in the heart of a wilful ſinner, that goeth on in a courſe of known Sin, can be but Preſumptions; and therefore every Soul that thus liveth and walketh, muſt either be a <hi>Preſumptuous Perſon,</hi> or one that <hi>deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;</hi> for he muſt either have <hi>ſome Hope,</hi> or no Hope: if he hath <hi>no Hope at all,</hi> it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe he is under <hi>Deſpair,</hi> or becauſe he is an <hi>Athiſt,</hi> and never mindeth and regardeth any thing but what he ſhould <hi>Eat</hi> or <hi>Drink</hi> and <hi>Put on,</hi> and how his Poſterity ſhall live when he is dead: If he hath <hi>any Hope,</hi> it can be no other then a <hi>Preſumptuous Hope;</hi> for he hath not one line in Scripture to juſtify it. <hi>There is no peace to the Wicked</hi> (ſaith God) ſo that without cleanſing our ways, and taking heed thereto, according to the Word of God, there is no avoiding the guilt of <hi>Atheiſm, Deſpair,</hi> or <hi>Preſumption;</hi> and this is a very dreadful Meditation, but ſuch as nothing can be truer. We ſee there are but few, very few that deſpair; ſo that as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Proſperity ſlayeth the Fool:</hi> ſo it is either <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and a Careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:62919:177"/> as to any conſideration of another life, or elſe <hi>Preſumption,</hi> that ſlayeth the moſt of thoſe poor Souls which go down into the Pit.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Sixthly, <hi>Be much in Prayer to God</hi> to guide you in the examining of your ſtate, and to keep you from taking up with vain Confidences; take the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Man according to Gods own Heart, <hi>Pſal. 129. 23. Search me O God, and know mine Heart, try me, and know my Thoughts, and ſee if there be any wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed way in me, and lead me in the way e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting.</hi> Beg of God to give you that good hope, through grace, which he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth, to beget you to a lively hope, and not to ſuffer you to pleaſe your ſelves with a <hi>Preſumptuous Hope;</hi> that as to your hopes for Eternity, it may not be to you as the Prophet ſpeaketh, <hi>Iſaiah 29. 8. As when an hungry Man dreameth, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold he eateth; but he awakes and his Soul is empty; and behold he drinketh, but he awaketh and behold he is faint, and his Soul hath Appetite.</hi>

                  <hi>Trembling;</hi> Phil. 2. 12. It is true, there is a <hi>ſtate of Love,</hi> that caſteth out <hi>Fear; perfect Love caſts our Fear</hi> (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) and <hi>Paul</hi> tells us <hi>Rom. 8. We have not received the ſpirit of bondage again to fear;</hi> but a fear leaſt we ſhould offend God, a <hi>fear</hi> leaſt we ſhould <hi>deceive our own Souls,</hi> is an excellent guard and protection to a Soul: if it riſeth indeed to cauſe a <hi>diſtruſt in God,</hi> or a <hi>deſpair of his Goodneſs,</hi> then it is putrified, then it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoureth God; and ſuch a fear ought not to be endured in a believers Soul: but there is a <hi>Cautious, Wary, Ingenious, Well-regulated Fear,</hi> that well becometh even the beſt Souls, while they are in their ſtate of Corruption and Mortality, and where they are daily incompaſſed with Temptations.</p>
